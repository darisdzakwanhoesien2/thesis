# Materiality Assessment [GRI 3-1]

BRI actively identifies ESG issues and integrates them into management activities, ensuring transparent communication with stakeholders through materiality assessments. The outcomes of these assessments are disclosed across BRI's communication channels and media.

In this report, BRI selects sustainability disclosure topics using a double materiality assessment process, aligned with the GRI Standards 2021, IFRS S1 and S2 Sustainability Disclosure Standards, focusing on financial materiality for investors, as guided by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

# Assessment Process: Double Materiality [GRI 3-1]

BRI adopts the principle of double materiality in determining material topics, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of both corporate and stakeholder interests, as well as financial and non-financial impacts. This approach allows BRI to evaluate its capacity to identify relevant sustainability factors that contribute to long-term value creation and assess the interrelation between external impacts (on society and the environment) and internal impacts (on corporate value).

In this report, BRI incorporates a financial materiality assessment centered on investors, following the ISSB guidelines. This approach ensures that investors (including capital markets participants and potential investors) along with other key stakeholders, can identify sustainability topics that may influence investment decision-making. To assess the financial impact on investors, BRI analyzes key investor interests in sustainability-related risks and opportunities and government regulations. Through this process, BRI discloses relevant sustainability information to user groups whose primary objective is economic decision-making (particularly investors and government regulators). Additionally, several corporate value creation topics are already reflected in the annual financial statements.
