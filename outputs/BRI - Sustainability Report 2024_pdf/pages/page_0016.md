# Business and ESG Overview

As a public company, BRI ensures transparent disclosure of its financial and non-financial information to the public and regulators adhering to applicable regulations. A comprehensive disclosure on financial and non-financial conditions, including a comparison between targets and achievements in the company's portfolio, financing targets, and investments, is available in the BRI Annual Report 2024. [2-3] [201-2] [201-4]

Throughout 2024, BRI optimized its office network management by opening, merging, and changing the status of its office network. As a result, the number of operational work units was reduced from 7,755 in 2023 to 7,568 in 2024. This decision was made after evaluating internal and external business dynamics. Additionally, no significant changes in 2024 have impacted BRI's operations.[1,4][200,2-6]

In 2024, BRI received a 3% tax rate reduction as an incentive from the Government of Indonesia, granted under Law No. 2 of 2020. The bank did not receive any income derived from opportunities or financial impacts related to climate change. [GB 3-3] [201-2] [201-4]
