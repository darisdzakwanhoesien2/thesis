## 1 Product Information Communication

BRI ensures that the dissemination of product information aligns with new service innovations, product launches, and updates to product terms, reaching both existing and potential customers.

BRI trains and deploys information agents who serve as financial advisors and educators.

## Responsible Product Marketing

BRI upholds a fair marketing policy that prioritizes transparency, financial literacy, and regulatory compliance, ensuring the protection of consumer rights, while maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial system. Grounded in the Fair Marketing Communication Policy, this approach emphasizes transparency, fairness, reliability, confidentiality, and data security, all of which are directly applied by BRI employees in customer interactions.

Clear and transparent communication is fundamental to providing customers with sufficient information about product and services, including their names, types, benefits, requirements, costs, interest or profit-sharing calculations, and validity periods. BRI ensures equal treatment for all customers, regardless of their background or financial status, and guarantees the integrity and accuracy of all transactions. Employees are encouraged to conduct marketing activities in a transparent and ethical manner, prioritizing customer education alongside product promotion. This involves delivering clear, easily accessible information, outlining both risks and benefits to help customers make informed financial decisions. Digital platforms such as BRImo and Qlola enhance the educational efforts, catering to an increasingly digital-savvy customer base. Beyond marketing teams, Frontline teams (Universal Bankers and Customer Service) and BRI Contact Agents also play a role in product marketing activities through Cross-Selling, Outbound Calls, and Customer Visits,
