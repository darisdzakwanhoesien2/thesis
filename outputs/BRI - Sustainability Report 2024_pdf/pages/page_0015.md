Review of Sustainable Finance Action Plan Implementation

BRI integrates sustainable financial governance through the Sustainable Finance Action Plan (RAKB), aligning with the Financial Services Authority Regulation (POJK) No. 51/POJK.03/2017 on sustainable finance implementation. The RAKB framework incorporates environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) aspects. The RAKB implementation spans various key functions, including risk management, change management, investor relations, planning and performance, corporate secretariat, product development, and project management. These efforts prioritize environmentally sound financing, the BRI Peduli program, and eco-friendly operational practices. [131][13081-04-P01]
