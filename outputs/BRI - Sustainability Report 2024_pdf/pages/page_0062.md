Beyond systems and policies, BRI prioritises staff competency and professionalism. Employees involved in credit collection undergo specialized training, certification, and continuous support to ensure they fully understand credit collection procedures while maintaining empathy and sensitivity towards customers' financial situations.
As part of its commitment to offering constructive solutions, BRI provides credit restructuring options for debtors experiencing financial difficulties, taking into account their good faith, cooperation, and business continuity. Additionally, BRI offers an alternative resolution through the debt sale mechanism (cessie).
Every action taken is carefully considered to ensure fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial outcomes for all parties involved. Through this responsible and dignified credit collection approach, BRI not only upholds its role as a financial institution but also as a trusted partner dedicated to maintaining strong customer relationships and supporting long-term financial well-being.
