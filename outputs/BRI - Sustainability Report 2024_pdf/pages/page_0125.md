## Long-Term Incentives for Employees [F.18]

To foster a sense of ownership among employees, BRI offers both long-term incentives through stock ownership programs: namely the Employee Stock Allocation Program (ESA) and the Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), which have been in place since 2016.

### 1. Employee Stock Allocation (ESA)

The ESA program is a stock ownership initiative distributed in four stages to all employees who meet specific eligibility criteria set by BRI. These criteria include length of service, individual performance, and track record in fulfilling responsibilities.

### 2. Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)

The ESOP program grants employees the opportunity to purchase company stock at a special price. It is offered to employees at specific levels who are recognized as High Potential Talent and Value Creators within BRI.

## Promoting Lifelong Learning for Employee Development [F.22]

BRI is committed to continuous employee development, implementing a range of policies and programs designed to provide learning opportunities, enhance competencies, and support career progression. Development initiatives focus on strengthening both technical (hard) and interpersonal (soft) skills, ensuring employees are equipped with the necessary skills to excel in their roles or fields. In terms of career development, BRI offers structured programs such as promotions and rotations, aligning employees' career aspirations with organization's needs. BRI's career management framework is built on principles that emphasize aligning job requirements with employee capabilities, competency-based evaluations, and strategic career movement, fostering long-term growth. To reinforce its commitment to employee development, BRI established the BRI Corporate University in 2015, with six campuses strategically located across Indonesia. The institution is officially accredited as a corporate training provider (Lembaga Pelatihan Kerja, LPK) by the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration. In addition

to its training programs, BRI Corporate University oversees the Professional Certification Institute (LSP), founded in 2019. Notably, it became the first LSP in the Indonesian banking industry to receive licensing from the National Professional Certification Agency (BNSP) under Decree No. KEP.0351/BNSP/II/2020, certifying employees' professional competencies in accordance with national standards.

To anticipate and meet future competency demands, BRI has established various talent development programs aimed at equipping employees with critical skills and expertise to adapt to evolving industry challenges while driving organizational growth. Key initiatives include: [GR 404-2]
