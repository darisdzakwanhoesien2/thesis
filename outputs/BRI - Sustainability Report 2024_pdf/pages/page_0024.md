# Management of Material Issues Impacting BRI and Stakeholders [3-1][3-2]

Based on the materiality assessment, BRI has identified two key categories of material issues that significantly impact both management and stakeholders: Impact Material Topics (inside-out approach) and Financial Material Topics (outside-in approach).

For Impact Material Topics, two issues arise from BRI's activities and have direct impact on stakeholders and society: (1) sustainable finance (include Climate Risk) and (2) customer service excellence. Additionally, three issues were identified as directly impacting BRI's financial performance: (3) financial inclusion and literacy, (4) cybersecurity, and (5) good corporate governance.

|  Topic | Type of Topic | Materiality Consideration | Strategy | KPI Related to Board of Directors | Achievement  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Sustainable Finance (including Climate Risk) | Impact Material Topic | According to the Double Materiality chart, Sustainable Finance is a material topic with significant impacts on both the company and its stakeholders. However, given the importance of investor-focused material topics and financial considerations under IFRS, Sustainable Finance has been integrated into Climate Risk, making it a core component of the company's strategy for navigating climate-related risks. Climate risk poses a significant threat to BRI's financial stability and performance, as climate change introduces both physical risks, (e.g., extreme weather events), and transition risks, (e.g., regulatory changes and technological shifts). These risks can affect the creditworthiness of borrowers in climate-sensitive sectors, the valuation of BRI's assets, as well as increased credit risk and reduced lending opportunities in sectors like agriculture and energy, which are highly sensitive to climate impacts. To mitigate these risks, BRI is actively developing responsible financing products and policies, including screening and exclusionary financing policies and green financing solutions. Sustainable finance is essential for bridging the financial support gap for sustainability initiatives. BRI plays a key role in providing capital for businesses and individuals to transition to low-carbon and sustainable practices, while also supporting government efforts in expanding green financing solutions. | BRI adopts a comprehensive strategy that integrates sustainability across all financial activities. This strategy includes: • Green Products: Develop green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and ESG-focused investment funds. • Sectoral Policies: Establish tailored sustainability guidelines for high-impact sectors such as palm oil, pulp & paper, oil & gas, and coal to promote sustainable practice. • Customer Engagement: Collaborate with clients to transition toward sustainable business models • Capacity Building: Train staff on sustainable finance principles and emerging regulations to ensure effective policy. • Partnerships: Collaborate with multilateral organizations and green finance programs to expand BRI's sustainable financial offerings. • Innovation: Leverage financial technology and data analytics to measure and report the impact of sustainable finance activities. | Sustainable Financing or Credit | IDR 785.22 Trillion  |
|  Customer Service Excellence | Impact Material Topic | Customer excellence and service quality are critical to the success and competitiveness of commercial banks. BRI prioritizes high-quality, personalized, and emotionally engaging services to meet customers' needs and expectations, ensuring an enhanced customer loyalty and trust, stronger financial performance, increased profitability, and a sustainable competitive advantage, differentiating BRI in the banking industry. | Clear Alignment: Develop a well-defined strategy that directly aligns customer excellence with BRI's mission and objectives. Customer-Centric Approach: Embed customer needs into product design, service delivery, and organizational culture. Technology Integration: Leverage digital tools such as AI-powered chatbots, mobile banking apps, and CRM systems to enhance customer interaction and personalization. Employee Training: Invest in comprehensive training programs to ensure employees provide exceptional customer service.
