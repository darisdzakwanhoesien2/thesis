# Human Capital Management: BRILiaN Individual

## Equal Employment Opportunities

BRI is committed to fostering an inclusive and equitable workplace by upholding the principles of equality, diversity, and non-discrimination in career development. The bank ensures that all employees have equal opportunities, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, religion, race, or any other discriminatory factors. BRI has established a comprehensive anti-discrimination policy encompassing all aspects of human resource management, including recruitment, career development, and remuneration.[F 18]

In alignment with this commitment, BRI has implemented the Respectful Workplace Policy to uphold a culture of mutual respect and compliance with the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises Circular No. SE-3/MBU/04/2022 of 2022 on the Policy of Mutual Respect in the Workplace within State-Owned Enterprises.[GRI 3-3]

## Principle of Respectful Workplace Policy

Recognizing and respecting differences in a diverse work environment with various ethnic backgrounds, races, nationalities, skin colors, ages, religions, genders, disabilities, viewpoints, or other individual characteristics and points of view, to encourage a productive work environment.

A guarantee from work unit leaders that no employee is treated differently because of their personal characteristics, and has equal and fair access to company facilities and infrastructure.

Create and build a work environment with respect for each other and no discrimination, violence or harassment in any form.

This policy is designed to cultivate a workplace environment that upholds mutual respect and is free from discrimination, exclusion, restriction, bullying, harassment, and all forms of violence, both mental and physical. By fostering an inclusive, supportive, and productive work atmosphere, the policy reinforces the Company's commitment to sustainability and the protection of human rights.[GRI 3-3]

BRI has issued internal regulations through the Board of Directors' Letter No. B.1221-DIR/HCS/07/2022 on the Respectful Workplace Policy. This directive outlines key points, including:

1. Definitions of a respectful workplace, discrimination, violence, and harassment;
2. Criteria for acts of discrimination, violence, and harassment;
3. Principles of a respectful workplace; and
4. Preventive measures, handling procedures, and monitoring mechanisms.

BRI underscores the critical role of leaders as role models in fostering a conducive work environment that enhances employee productivity. The bank maintains a zero-tolerance policy against all forms of harassment, both sexual and non-sexual, as well as discrimination in the workplace or any work-related activities. As part of its firm stance, BRI has established a Whistleblowing System (WBS) to report and address violations. Such behaviors are deemed unacceptable and fundamentally incompatible with BRI's core values, which emphasize inclusivity and the creation of a safe working environment for all employees.[GRI 3-3]

## Workforce Composition

All employee regulations at BRI comply with Labor Law No. 13 of 2003 and have incorporated the provisions of Government Regulation in Lieu of Law (Perpu) No. 2 of 2022 on Job Creation, which took effect on December 30, 2022. The Collective Labor Agreement (PKB) is reviewed and updated every two years to clearly define the rights and responsibilities of the company, labor unions, and employees, ensuring the maintenance of harmonious working relations while upholding the principles of healthy industrial relations.[GRI 3-3][GRI 2-3F][GRI 407-1]

As of December 31, 2024, BRI employs 81,848 individuals, consisting of 59,495 permanent employees (72.69%), 22,244 contract employees (27.18%), and 109 trainees (0.13%). All employees work full-time, with no part-time workers or unguaranteed working hours. Among permanent employees, 39,176 (65.85%) are members of the BRI Workers' Union, which is exclusively composed of permanent employees. However, the outcomes of labor negotiations apply to all BRI employees, regardless of union membership.
