# Risk Management

## Risk Monitoring Committee (KPMR)

The Risk Monitoring Committee supports the Board of Commissioners in evaluating and ensuring that risk management practices adhere to established procedures and methodologies. This oversight ensures that BRI's activities remain within acceptable risk limits, reinforcing effective control over the bank's operations.

## Risk Management Committee (KMR)

The Risk Management Committee is responsible for formulating and revising Risk Management Policies, including overseeing the implementation of risk management strategies and contingency plans. This committee ensures proactive risk management, particularly in response to abnormal external conditions.

## Risk Management Work Unit (SKMR)

The Risk Management Work Unit (SKMR) is an independent division dedicated to executing risk management processes. It operates separately from the Operational Work Unit (UKO), Internal Audit Work Unit (SKAI), and Compliance Work Unit.

## Internal Audit Work Unit (SKAI)

The Internal Audit Work Unit (SKAI) is responsible for assessing and enhancing the effectiveness of risk management, internal controls, and governance processes within the organization.

## Risk Management Process

Each operational work unit at BRI is responsible for implementing the risk management process through an internal control system integrated into their operational and business activities. This process encompasses key stages, including risk identification, measurement, monitoring, and risk control. Risk management is executed continuously through three lines model, where risk-taking units serve as the first line, compliance and risk management units provide oversight as the second line, and the internal audit unit ensures independent assurance as the third line.

To ensure effective coordination and compliance with regulatory requirements, BRI's Board of Directors has established a risk management function at every organizational level, including the Head Office (Division/Desk/Team), Regional Offices, Special Branch Offices, Branch Offices, Sub-Branch Offices, BRI Units, Cash Offices, BRI Priority Service Centers, and Overseas Work Units (UKLN).

Operational risk management is conducted in alignment with BRI's governance framework, which upholds regulatory standards and industry best practices. The measurement and assessment of operational risks are conducted through various methodologies, including Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), New Bank Product Risk Management Assessment (PBB), Loss Event Database (LED), Key Risk Indicator (KRI) Monitoring, Risk Assessment Plan (RAP), and Disaster Threat Risk Assessment (PRAB).

Operational risk management reports are submitted periodically to management, unit leaders, and other relevant stakeholders to facilitate continuous monitoring and risk mitigation. The Operational Risk Division (ORD) is responsible for preparing both mandatory and internal operational risk reports to ensure ongoing oversight and improvement.

The scope and format of operational risk management reports include, among others, the bank's operational risk profile, regional risk profile, Operational Risk News (OPEN), and analysis reports of UAI (Unit Audit Internal) risk. In cases where UAI (Unit Audit Internal) verification results indicate potential fraud, the report is escalated to the RCEO (Regional Chief Executive Officer) and the ORD Division for further investigation and appropriate action.

## Stress-Testing Simulation [FN-CB-5504.2]

Stress testing is a critical risk assessment tool employed by BRI to measure potential losses under abnormal and extreme market conditions. BRI regularly conducts stress-testing simulations at least once per quarter to assess vulnerabilities that may not be apparent under normal conditions but could pose significant risks during extreme scenarios. This process utilizes specific scenarios to evaluate the sensitivity of BRI's financial performance to changes in risk factors and to assess their impacts on various portfolios, including:

1. Stress testing for Credit Risk evaluates the potential for default under adverse economic conditions (Credit Risk Stress Testing).
2. Stress testing for Market Risk analyzes the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (Market Risk Stress Testing).
3. Stress testing for Liquidity Risk assesses potential liquidity constraints arising from stress conditions (Liquidity Risk Stress Test).

Beyond portfolio analysis, this simulation also plays a vital role in managing systemic risk within BRI. The results are utilized to assess the adequacy of the bank's capital buffers and liquidity levels, ensuring resilience against macroeconomic shocks. These insights are integral to capital planning, long-term strategic development, and the overall management of BRI's business activities.
