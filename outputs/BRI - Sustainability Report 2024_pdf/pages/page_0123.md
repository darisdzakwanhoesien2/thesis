# Human Capital Management: BRILiaN Individual

## Employees with Disabilities [F.18]

BRI is committed to providing equal opportunities for persons with disabilities (PwDs) to actively participate in its business activities by aligning job roles and responsibilities with their individual skills and competencies.

To further empower PwDs, BRI has introduced the BRI Sahabat Disabilitas training and apprenticeship program, equipping them with the necessary skills and competencies to successfully enter the workforce.

In addition to fostering inclusivity, BRI is dedicated to ensuring the comfort and safety of its PWD employees by providing assistive equipment and tailored physical and non-physical facilities. The bank also offers training and capacity-building programs, alongside a Talent Development System-based career management framework, to support professional growth and career advancement of employees with disabilities.

## Employee Potential Development Initiatives

Effective human resource development cultivates a positive work environment, strengthens organizational commitment, and enhances job satisfaction. By improving employee performance, increasing workplace engagement, and reducing turnover, it plays a vital role in driving the company's overall success.

## Performance Bootcamp Program as an Effort to Enhance Performance

To manage the performance of the Company, Business Units, and Individuals, BRI has implemented a structured performance management process. This process ensures that individual performance aligns with corporate objectives, enhances employee motivation, and supports the achievement of optimal performance.

Individual performance management is thoroughly evaluated, including the management of employees who fall below the minimum required performance standards (underperformers). To address this, BRI has established the Performance Bootcamp program, designed to help employees meet performance standards through buddy support, training, mentoring, coaching, and counseling. Employees who do not successfully complete the Performance Bootcamp will be subject to further follow-up actions and consequences as determined by company policies.

## Employee Recruitment [F54] [F.18] [ORI 3-3] [F54] [F.18]

To attract and develop top young talent across Indonesia, BRI has established several strategic recruitment and development programs.

1. BRILiaN Scholarship Program (BSP): An early recruitment initiative designed to identify and nurture talented young individuals, serving as a character-building platform before they officially join BRI.
2. BRILiaN Creativity Contest (BCCP): A competition where participants showcase innovative ideas, either individually or in teams, that can contribute positively to both the nation and BRI. This initiative helps BRI identify top talent through their creativity and problem-solving abilities.
3. BRILiaN Internship Program (BIP): A structured internship program providing hands-on training experiences for high school/vocational school graduates, university students, or fresh graduates, while also supporting BRI's operational units.
4. BRILiaN Future Leader Program (BFLP): A recruitment and educational program designed to attract high-potential candidates from external sources and prepare them for future leadership roles.
5. BRILiaN Next Leader Program (BNLP): A leadership pipeline program dedicated to internal BRI employees with high potential, equipping them with the necessary skills to become future company leaders.
6. BRILiaN Banking Officer Program (BBOP): A recruitment and training initiative aimed at preparing new employees at the assistant level, sourced both externally and internally, ensuring they meet BRI's operational standards and values.
7. BRILiaN Relationship Manager Program (BRMP): A targeted recruitment and development program for employees in marketing roles at Corporate Band 6 or Junior Manager levels, designed to maximize performance while aligning with BRI's operational standards and core values.
8. BRILiaN Specialist Hiring Program (BSHP): A specialized recruitment initiative targeting professionals with expertise in specific fields, ensuring BRI acquires the right talent to meet its evolving business needs.
