# BRI Green Initiative

## Emission Avoidance from Products and Services [F.12]

One of BRI's key emission avoidance initiatives involves encouraging customers to maximize the use of digital platforms, thereby reducing the carbon footprint associated with travel, transportation, and other activities required for in-person transactions at branch offices or ATMs. By analyzing transaction behaviors across branch offices and digital platforms, and aligning with the ISO 14064 methodology on Greenhouse Gases, BRI can estimate the amount of emissions avoided through the increased adoption of digital banking solutions:

|  Type of Service | Frequency (in thousand) | Emission Avoidance (kgCO2e)  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  BRImo | 4,309,334 | 782,697  |
|  Merchant BRI | 509,526 | 92,544  |
|  Qlola | 14,223 | 2,583  |
|  BRILink | 1,204,251 | 218,726  |

Data collection was carried out through the distribution of digital questionnaires to customers, aiming to gather comprehensive insights into customer demographics, the average distance to BRI ATMs or branch offices, the types of vehicles used, the fuel efficiency of the most commonly used vehicles, and the utilization of smartphones for daily transactions

## Green and Smart Building [F.12]

BRI integrates the green building concept into its owned and utilized properties. In 2024, a total of 000 buildings received green certification from the Green Building Council Indonesia. This follows the Greenship Gold Certification (version 1.2) awarded in 2023 to BRILiaN Tower by the Green Building Council Indonesia.

## Energy Use [F.6] [F.7] [GRI 302-1] [GRI 302-2] [GRI 302-3] [GRI 302-4]

BRI operates in the absence of specific regulations governing energy use for commercial banks. However, the bank has proactively implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption across its operations. These efforts are aimed at enhancing efficiency, supporting environmental sustainability, and minimizing Scope 1 emissions to the greatest extent possible. [GRI 3-1]

BRI conducted an energy assessment at its Headquarters and designated 2022 as the baseline year for its energy reduction plan. Several initiatives have been introduced, including optimizing electricity usage, fostering an energy-conscious workplace culture, adopting energy-efficient technologies such as LED lighting, optimizing elevator operations, and reducing fuel consumption by enforcing vehicle age restrictions and regular maintenance. Additionally, BRI currently operates 796 eco-friendly vehicles (including motorcycles and cars) as part of its efforts to reduce emissions and transition to low-carbon economic activities.[F-7] BRI focuses on managing energy consumption within its own operations, therefore, this report does not disclose energy usage beyond BRI's direct activities [GRI 302-2]

In 2024, the total energy consumption reached 2,848,795,079 MJ, sourced from electricity usage and vehicle fuel consumption, exclusively for office operations. Electricity is supplied entirely by PT PLN (Persero), while operational vehicles utilize a combination of fossil fuel and electricity. As PT PLN (Persero) has not yet provided specific details on the energy mix used for electricity production, this report does not present consolidated data on energy consumption from renewable versus nonrenewable energy sources. [GRI 302-5]

|  Description | Unit | 2022 | 2023 | 2024  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Total Fuel Consumption [GRI 302-] | Liter | 44,922,960 | 42,927,942 | 42,521,434  |
|  Electricity Consumption | kWh | 404,925,311 | 403,192,231 | 383,878,408  |
|  Total Energy Consumption Within the Organization | MJ | 3,074,957,680 | 2,919,627,648 | 2,848,795,079  |
|  Energy Intensity by Number of Offices | MJ/office/year | 374,584 | 376,483 | 376,426  |
|  Energy Intensity by Number of Employees | MJ/office/year | 26,078 | 24,271 | 23,620  |

Energy calculations and conversion factors in this process follow the IPCC (1998) methodology, as adopted by the Indonesian government through the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Inventory for the Energy Sector guidelines published by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (2020).

To enhance transparency and accuracy in energy tracking, BRI has initiated the recording of energy usage across all working units. Additionally, the bank has implemented various initiatives aimed at fostering behavioral and operational improvements, including the adoption of digital technologies to optimize energy efficiency and intensity. As of 2024, BRI has not yet calculated energy reductions or savings for its services and products sold, although it has conducted calculations for financed emissions. [GRI 302-4] [GRI 302-5]
