## Building Collective Awareness of Sustainable Impact

BRI is committed to supporting and actively participating in initiatives that align with its strategic objectives, fostering a positive impact from the sustainable finance sector on society. This commitment drives BRI to engage in both national and global sustainability initiatives, including those in alignment with the Paris Agreement, while also advocating for human rights protection, inclusive growth and diversity.

## National Support

BRI actively supports various initiatives aligned with the Paris Agreement, including the Indonesian Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, the 2021-2025 Sustainable Finance Initiative issued by the Financial Services Authority (OJK), and Indonesia's net-zero emission target for 2060. In line with these commitments, BRI has incorporated the government's climate change targets into its Sustainable Finance Action Plan, aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Currently, BRI is a member of the National Banking Association named Perhimpunan Bank Nasional (Perbanas), an organization of financial institutions that contributes to formulating policies related to banking. Perbanas operates under the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN), which has demonstrated alignment with the Paris Agreement through various policies and initiatives. This reflects the implementation of climate change risk mitigation and the pursuit of business opportunities within Indonesia's climate-resilient economy, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Additionally, BRI actively participates in the Banking Compliance Director Communication Forum (FKDKP), which plays a key role in promoting banking compliance and best governance practices across the industry.

## Global Support

Since 2023, BRI has been part of the global sustainability initiative led by the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), reinforcing its commitment to advancing the SDGs through the UNGC's ten universal principles. This commitment was formalized through the signing of the agreement, followed by the submission of the Communication on Progress in both 2023 and 2024.
