# Human Capital Management: BRILiaN Individual

## Fair Compensation [F.18] [F.20] [GRI 3-3] [GRI 405-2]

BRI recognizes that employee career development and performance evaluation are interconnected processes that drive professional growth and organizational success. Through structured performance evaluations, BRI assesses and measures employees' capabilities based on their current roles and future career aspirations, enabling the development of targeted employee programs that align with individual needs.

Employee performance is reviewed semi-annually and annually through both individual-based (Individual KPI) and team-based (Division KPI) assessments. These evaluations are further enhanced by continuous feedback mechanisms through Courageous Performance Dialogue (CPD). By integrating these elements, BRI provides a structured platform for in-depth discussions on individual and team achievements, as well as areas for improvement, ensuring alignment between organizational strategies and long-term goals. [F5-4]

In 2024, 100% of BRI employees received training, performance evaluations, and career development reviews. [GRI 405-2]

BRI upholds the principle of equality by implementing a performance-driven remuneration strategy and a merit-based salary structure. Incentives and bonuses are provided to motivate employees. Salary levels are determined based on job classification, work experience, workload, and performance achievements, supporting career progression for female employees without gender-based disparities. There are no compensation differences between male and female employees for the same role and responsibilities.

Additionally, BRI considers the cost of living and Regional Minimum Wages (UMR) across different locations to ensure that all employees earn above the UMR. In 2024, the lowest average salary at BRI was 1.09 times the regional minimum wage. Maintaining competitive remuneration is a core principle at all job levels, including entry-level positions. [F.20] [GRI 202-1] [GRI 405-2]

Additionally, in 2024, approximately 11.69% of BRI employees, a total of 9,569 individuals, received promotions. [GRI 2-21]

BRI applies Remuneration Policy No. SE.36-DIR/HCS/12/2024, issued on December 30, 2024, governing Employee Remuneration. The remuneration strategy is aligned with the banking industry best practices and benchmarked against market standards.

There are no conflicts of interest between BRI and its remuneration consultants, and the company strictly adheres to all applicable regulations governing the remuneration system. [2-20]
