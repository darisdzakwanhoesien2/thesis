# Human Capital Management: BRILiaN Individual

Employees will be provided with development programs tailored to their specific needs, considering their corporate title, role, or talent cluster. Based on Corporate Title: Employees will participate in leadership development programs focusing on character building, national insights, global perspectives, business acumen, and technological proficiency. These programs are designed to prepare employees for advancement to higher corporate titles. Based on Role: Employees will receive specialized training to equip them with the knowledge and skills required for their respective roles. Based on Talent Cluster: Employees identified as top talent will undergo specialized training programs tailored to prepare them for more complex and strategic roles.

BRI's employee education and training programs are conducted through a combination of internal training and collaborations with accredited, competent, and experienced external educational service providers. This approach underscores the bank's commitment to delivering high-quality learning facilities, strengthening employee competencies through comprehensive and impactful development programs.

# Enhancing Understanding of Sustainable Finance [E-2] [P-1] [GRI 2-24] [GRI 404-2] [GRI G4 FS4]

To strengthen employees' understanding of sustainable finance, BRI has integrated sustainable finance concepts into its e-learning curriculum. As part of this initiative, an overview of sustainable finance is included as a module in BRISMART e-learning, providing employees with accessible learning resources. In 2024, a total of 39,460 employees participated in online sustainable finance literacy training, achieving an impressive completion rate of 99.91% on average.

# Employee Engagement

BRI is committed to fostering a conducive work environment, one of which is achieved through measuring employee engagement levels via the Employee Engagement Survey (EES). This survey, conducted across all employees, serves as a comprehensive assessment of employee attitudes, behaviors, and relationships with their work and the organization. It also functions as a valuable tool for evaluating engagement levels and as a medium for capturing employee aspirations to enhance human resource management.

The engagement index reflects employees' level of involvement and commitment to BRI, measured through an average employee score on a scale from 1 to 4. This scale assesses key factors, including employee pride in being part of the company, their willingness to remain with BRI, and their dedication to consistently delivering their best performance.

BRI's employee engagement framework evaluates the quality of several critical aspects, including:

1. understanding of the company's vision, mission, goals, and strategies, and their influence on employee motivation;
2. leadership credibility;
3. internal communication and collaboration; and
4. employee well-being, encompassing empowerment, a safe and comfortable work environment, opportunities for learning and growth, fair compensation and benefits, recognition and appreciation, work-life balance, and overall job satisfaction.

|  Description | 2024  |
| --- | --- |
|  Employee Engagement | 3.51 / 4.00  |
|  Survey Scope | 73.4%  |

Employee engagement plays a key role in driving job satisfaction. One key indicator of employee satisfaction is the turnover rate. In 2024, BRI achieved a turnover rate of 1.29%, demonstrating strong employee retention and reinforcing its positive performance in comparison to industry average.

# Mechanism for Managing Employee Complaints

Employee complaints, including those related to discrimination, exclusion, restriction, sexual and non-sexual harassment, bullying, and other forms of violence, are handled through employee disciplinary procedures. Any perpetrators who cause harm to employees will be subject to employment regulations and, if proven guilty, may face sanctions up to and including termination of employment.

Employees have access to multiple internal communication channels to voice their concerns, including the Human Capital Call Center, BRI HC Assistant, and the BASIC menu on the BRIStars app, all managed by Human Capital, as well as the company's whistleblower system (WBS). Through these channels, employees can submit questions, complaints, suggestions, and concerns in a safe and structured manner.

Additionally, employees have the option to receive coaching from internal BRI coaches or counseling with external professional counselors when needed. BRI ensures strict confidentiality for all data and information shared during coaching and counseling sessions. [GRI2-26]
