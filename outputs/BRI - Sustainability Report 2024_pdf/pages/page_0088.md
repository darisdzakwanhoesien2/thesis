# Strategy
1. Socialization and Internalization of a Personal Data Protection Culture: Awareness campaigns and internalization efforts are key components of BRI's privacy initiatives, conducted across headquarters and branch offices. These activities frequently feature external data protection experts, ensuring that employees receive accurate and up-to-date information.
2. Privacy Mini Quiz: To assess employees' understanding of personal data protection, BRI actively conducts interactive mini quizzes covering topics related to data processing within the organization. These quizzes serve as a tool to measure comprehension knowledge gained through privacy training and awareness initiatives.
3. Privacy Training: In preparation for the enforcement of Indonesia's Personal Data Protection Law (Law No. 27 of 2022), BRI collaborates with data protection experts, including the Ministry of Communication and Informatics, to provide specialized training for all employees within the BRI Group.
4. E-learning: Information security is integrated into BRI's e-learning curriculum, ensuring employees acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to safeguard data privacy effectively.
5. Phishing Awareness Email Campaigns: BRI conducts targeted email campaigns designed to test and enhance employees' awareness of phishing threats and cybersecurity risks.
6. BRI Group Privacy Readiness Workshop: To strengthen compliance with the Personal Data Protection Law (UU PDP), BRI organized a Privacy Readiness Workshop on May 3, 2023. Attended by representatives from the Ministry of Communication and Informatics of the Republic of Indonesia, the workshop provided BRI Group with a comprehensive understanding of legal obligations and the technical implementation of data protection measures across organizational units.
BRI has undertaken a range of initiatives to strengthen its cybersecurity posture including:
1. Developing a structured governance framework for responding to information security incidents, aligned with BRI's Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) and Business Continuity Plan (BCP), as outlined in the Circular Letter on Business Continuity Management. The BCP is tested annually with end-users participation.
2. Establishing the BRI Cybersecurity Framework, which is integrated into the Enterprise Security Architecture (ESA), and follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.
3. Conducting gap analysis, maturity assessments, and developing BRI's information security roadmap
4. Developing advanced information security technologies and governance practices.
5. Establishing a dedicated Security Operation Center (SOC) that continuously monitors cybersecurity threats 24/7, 365 days a year.
6. Utilizing threat intelligence services from internationally recognized providers.
7. Monitoring and addressing brand abuse threats through a brand protection program, which tracks unauthorized use of the BRI brand on social media.
8. Identifying system vulnerabilities and conducting independent security reviews, including vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and simulated cyber-attacks (red team exercises).
9. Establishing a Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to respond swiftly to information security incidents.
10. Implementing communication protocols to ensure timely and transparent public disclosures of information security incidents.
11. Providing cybersecurity training for employees to prevent cybercrime threats.
12. Partnering with leading cybersecurity experts with global experience to conduct forensic reviews and cyber incident investigations.
