# Integrating Climate Risks

BRI continuously evaluates the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to its business operations. In its climate-related risk management framework, BRI not only identifies potential threats but also recognizes the opportunities that arise from climate-related transitions. By taking this approach, BRI views climate change not solely as a crisis but as a transformative opportunity to drive innovation, new ventures and sustainable growth.

To effectively assess climate risks and opportunities, BRI categorizes each risk's impact and duration, ensuring a structured and timely response. The impact on Business Resilience Initiatives is classified as high, medium, or low, while the duration of each identified risk is categorized as short-term, medium-term, or long-term. This structured assessment allows BRI to prioritize risks based on urgency and tailor responses accordingly.
