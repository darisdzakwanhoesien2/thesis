# Promoting Respect for Human Rights

BRI recognizes the significant impact of banking activities on human rights, both directly and indirectly. As a result, the bank adopts a proactive approach to human rights, focusing on risk management, reputation enhancement, and contributing to sustainable global development.

# Human Rights Governance

BRI is committed to upholding human rights across its entire business supply chain by integrating business-related human rights risks—such as forced labor, human trafficking, child labor, freedom of association, collective bargaining rights, fair remuneration, equality and non-discrimination, Privacy Protection, Sustainable Operating Environment and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)—into its risk management framework and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives. This commitment is reinforced through regular human rights due diligence across the Company's business operations. [GRI 3-5][FN-CB-410a.2]

To further strengthen its dedication to human rights, BRI adheres to the ten principles of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs on BHR), also known as the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC). This commitment extends to safeguarding human rights across BRI's operational and business activities, including labor practices, business partnerships, and supply chain management. The following are six of the ten UNGC principles related to human rights (Principles 1 and 2) and labor standards (Principles 3, 4, 5, and 6).

For more details on BRI's commitment to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, please refer to page 167.

The implementation of human rights policies across all operational activities at BRI is governed by the Human Rights in Employment Policy, the Respectful Workplace Policy (RWP), and the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Policy. These policies cover various relevant aspects for both BRI employees and the company's suppliers and partners. Each policy is designed to ensure that human rights principles are upheld and consistently applied, not only within the organization but also throughout the supply chain and in business partnerships.

# Human Rights Training and Awareness Initiatives

To communicate impacts to stakeholders, BRI implements several key actions:

1. Conducting periodic sessions to improve employees' understanding and awareness of human rights principles.
2. Sharing human rights practices and their impact through various channels, aligned with BRI's corporate communication standards.
3. Providing detailed human rights reports to external stakeholders through sustainability disclosures.

# Human Rights Assessment and Due Diligence

BRI is committed to upholding human rights across all its business processes by adopting a precautionary approach. This approach entails proactively managing the potential impacts of its

operations on human rights throughout the company's value chain. To achieve this, BRI conducts rigorous human rights due diligence, identifying and assessing potential impacts and risks stemming from its operational activities, value chain processes, business-related engagements, and new business relationships, including mergers and acquisitions. [7-19][GRI 3-5][GRI 408-1]

As part of its social responsibility, BRI places a strong emphasis on protecting vulnerable groups during the human rights due diligence process. This involves identifying and evaluating potential human rights risks not only within its direct operations but also across its broader value chain and associated business activities. By prioritizing these efforts, BRI reinforces its commitment to fostering a business ecosystem that respects, protects and promotes human rights, particularly for those most at risk.

Human rights assessments play a vital role in preventing and mitigating potential harm to individuals across all operational activities. Since 2023, BRI has integrated human rights assessments into both its internal and external business operations. These assessments are conducted periodically, based on organizational priorities and needs, to identify risks associated with human rights practices. During the assessment process, BRI systematically maps the frequency (likelihood) and impact (severity) of each identified risk, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both inherent and residual risks. In 2024, a total of 52,127 employees and 99 suppliers participated in the human rights assessment. Through these evaluations, BRI identified key human rights risks and established structured mitigation and remediation procedures to address them effectively. [GRI 3-5]

The human rights due diligence process, covering both internal operations and external business engagements, is guided by Director's Letter No. B.1470-DIR/ESG/07/2023, issued on July 13, 2023, regarding PT. Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.'s Human Rights Policy. This process is conducted through a structured framework comprising: 1) Human Rights Commitment; 2) Impact
