# Materials

Materials play a key role in HP's environmental impact and are central to advancing our circularity efforts. Across our products and packaging, HP is focusing on improving the circularity of our materials. This includes continuing responsible chemicals use and management as well as increasing the recycled and renewable content[57] of our products and packaging.

HP publishes information about the material content of typical HP personal systems and printers and continues to expand our full material disclosure program. In 2024, we collected an inventory of more than 90% of the substances by weight used in 97% of HP's 2024 EPEAT®-registered personal systems products.[58]

In 2024, HP used 839,800 tonnes[59] of materials in our products and packaging, a 0.1% decrease over the last year. 43% of total materials by weight were either recycled, reused, or renewable. Since 2019, HP has used more than 4B pounds of recycled, reused, and renewable (circular) materials. See the Data table for more details about HP materials use.

# Responsible Chemistry

As part of our commitment to sustainability leadership, HP is dedicated to reducing the environmental and human health impacts of materials and chemicals throughout our value chain. The HP Materials and Chemical Management Policy guides how we specify and restrict materials and chemicals for use in HP products, packaging, and manufacturing processes across our own operations. Supplier requirements are outlined in the HP General Specification for the Environment (GSE)—which is updated annually and includes environmental requirements for HP brand products—and in our Supplier Code of Conduct. HP is committed to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including requirements under restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) legislation globally.

We are also working to advance our exploration of safer alternatives to chemicals and materials in current products through the Framework to Guide Selection of Chemical Alternatives by the National Academy of Sciences and incorporating the methodology of GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals.

HP remains involved in several responsible chemistry initiatives under the Clean Production Action coalition, including the Chemical Footprint Project (CFP), a tool for benchmarking companies as they select safer alternatives and reduce their use of chemicals of high concern. In 2024, HP was once again recognized as a leader in CFP's annual survey for our chemical management programs and efforts to reduce our chemical footprint.[60]

In 2021, we became a Founding Signatory of the Toward Zero Exposure program by Green America's Clean Electronics Production Network, which protects workers from chemical hazards in the electronics supply chain.
