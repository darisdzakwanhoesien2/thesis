54 A 2023 Four Elements Consulting | (A) Cycle Assessment (CCA) study, commissioned by HP, provides a comparative environmental assessment of an Original HP Toner Cartridge (CF/20M) with an HP EvoCycle cartridge (CF/20MB), utilizing the most current data on production practices, recycling, product quality, and usage trends (see hp.com/go/SMEA-EvoCycle-HP-2023). The CCA leverages a 2021 Sperrural, dc Modability study, commissioned by HP, comprising: Original HP CF/20M toner cartridges with HP EvoCycle (CF/20MB) toner cartridges. For details, see https://www.sperruralhp.com/ report@HP-EvoCycle2021.pdf. The CCA concludes that the HP EvoCycle has a 37% lower carbon footprint than the HP CF/20M in the production phase and an 12% lower carbon footprint when looking at the entire life cycle of the cartridge.
55 Recycled plastic is expressed as a percentage of the total weight of plastic. Postconsumer recycled is based on the definition set in the EPBAT standard for imaging equipment, IEEE 1680.2.
56 Based on HP internal data collected in 2024 through connected presses reporting data.
57 Renewable content is defined per the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as "material derived from plentiful resources that are quickly replenished by ecological cycles or agricultural processes, so that the services provided by these and other linked resources are not endangered and remain available for the next generation."
58 These data reflect the number of EPBAT-registered product models for which substance inventory is collected, divided by the total number of EPBAT-registered product models.
59 2024 data do not include the following products or packaging for these products: some personal systems accessories and print accessories sold separately.
60 The results were not available at time of publication.
61 Recycled content must meet the ISO 14021 definition and be verified either via supplier declarations or material-level certifications (e.g. UL 2809; BCS Global Services/Recycled Content Standard; or equivalent).
62 Source: United Nations Environment Program.
63 Program availability varies. For details, see hp.com/recycle.
64 Calculation based on 16.9 ounce "single serve" bottled water containers.
65 Includes recycled plastic, metal, and fiber, renewable material or. Packaging and HP brand paper. Matrix is calculated using definitions in the Circularity Accounting manual.
66 Recycled content plastic as a percentage of total plastic used in all HP personal systems, printer hardware, and print cartridges shipped during the reporting year. Total volume excludes brand-licensed products and other market hardware accessories. Total recycled content plastic includes postconsumer recycled plastic, closed-loop plastic, and ocean-bound plastic used in HP products. Personal systems plastic is defined by EPBAT-eco label criteria. Subject to relevant restrictions on the use and distribution of materials destined for recycling and/or recycled feedstocks.

67 Recycled metal is expressed as a percentage of the total weight of the metal according to ISO 14021 definitions for metal parts over 25 grams.
68 Recycled plastic is expressed as a percentage of the total weight plastic. Postconsumer recycled is based on the definition set in the EPBAT standard for computers, IEEE 1680.1/878 standard.
69 Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Certified, meaning all components of our packaging come from reasonably managed forests to provide environmental benefits.
70 Postconsumer recycled is based on the definition set in the EPBAT standard for imaging equipment, IEEE 1680.2; and is expressed as a percentage of the total weight of plastic.
71 Original HP-like EvoMore Ink Cartridges contain at least 70% recycled content by weight of plastic. 80% of Original HP Ink Cartridges contain between 5-70% postconsumer recycled content. Does not include ink bottles or other products not listed. See http://hp.com/ IndiRecycledContent for Ink.
72 HP Envy-8500/8500k printers are made of at least 60% recycled plastic. Percentage of recycled plastic is calculated by plastic total weight.
73 Calculated as the percentage of primary plastic packaging (by weight) reduced per unit shipped. Excludes secondary and tertiary packaging components. Includes HP personal systems and printer hardware packaging. Does not include packaging for the following: Graphics Solutions hardware other than Pugwiklab 6, and DesignNet printers, 3D printing hardware, print supplies; refurbished products; and accessories such as third-party options, drop in box, and aftermarket options.
74 The number of countries or territories where HP offers legislation-driven and/or voluntary hardware take-back and recycling programs, and/or voluntary ink and/or toner take-back and recycling programs. Program availability varies. For details, see hp.com/recycle.
75 The number of countries or territories where HP offers legislation-based and/or voluntary hardware take-back and recycling programs. Program availability varies. For details, see hp.com/recycle.
76 The recycling rate is based on the weight of products returned for recycling compared with the weight of our product sales from seven years ago (the estimated average lifespan of our products). It is impractical for HPs report the recycling rate by product category as equipment is not typically carried at collection points. This rate also does not include packaging recycling, due to limited data available from recyclers.
77 The number of countries or territories where HP offers voluntary ink and/or toner take-back and recycling programs. Program availability varies. For details, see hp.com/recycle.
78 See hp.com/hprecycle for availability.

79 These include child labor, forced labor, severe forms of discrimination, health and safety issues posing immediate danger to life or risk of serious injury, and perceived violation of environmental laws posing serious and immediate harm to the community. We take such findings very seriously and require suppliers to cease all-related practices and report corrective actions taken within 30 days of the original audit. Recruitment fees must be reimbursed within 90 days of discovery. We are not the only on-site inspection within 90 days of discovery. We follow up closely to ensure that all required corrective actions are completed, and we visit sites to confirm resolution. Immediate priority findings do not necessarily involve termination of the supplier: we work with suppliers as appropriate to improve their performance and worker conditions in these areas.
80 Zero waste operations. Achieve 90% landfill diversion for non-hazardous solid waste across direct operations. The diversion methods include reuse, recycling, composting, and incineration (waste to energy recovery) solutions. Includes all HP-owned and managed sites worldwide.
81 HP directly trucks nonhazardous waste data for the company's highest energy consuming sites globally (10010 tonnes in 2025), which account for 67% of HPs operational waste. These sites provide a representative sample of the main types of facilities in our portfolio from across the regions where we operate.
82 We conduct PCFs, a subset of CCAs, of business HP desktops, instalcooks, tablets, workstations, thin clients, all-in-one computers, and displays to better understand the performance of individual products and our overall portfolio. These estimate total GHG emissions associated with a product over its lifetime and include emissions from materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and end-of-life management. To assess and report our complete personal systems PCF, we set up data these results to cover 90% of overall personal systems product sales by unit during the reporting year.
83 HP services are governed by the applicable HP terms and conditions of service provided or indicated to the customer at the time of purchase. Customer may have additional statutory rights according to applicable local laws, and such rights are not in any way affected by the HP terms and conditions of service or the HP Limited Warranty provided with HP products.
84 There are two offset options available: HP's Carbon Neutral to the Door option covers carbon offsetting of material extraction, component and product manufacturing, and product logistics. HP's Lifecycle option covers everything in the Carbon Neutral to the Door option plus device usage based on a four-year life cycle for commercial HP instalcooks and mobile workstations, and a five-year life cycle for commercial HP desktops, displays, and workstations, and end-of-service.
