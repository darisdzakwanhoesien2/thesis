# Circular Products and Packaging

Five principles guide HP's approach and drive progress toward a circular economy. Designing for circularity ensures that our products are durable, repairable, reusable, and recyclable. We prioritize materials that have the biggest impacts to ensure that we're focusing on the right areas, increasing recycled and renewable content where possible. We hold ourselves and our suppliers to well-defined responsible manufacturing standards. Additionally, we offer a range of services focused on repairing, recovering, reusing, and recycling our products to extend their lifespan and reduce their end-of-life impacts.

For more information about how we define and track our circularity efforts, view the HP Circularity Accounting Manual.
