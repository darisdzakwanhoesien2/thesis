|  Water consumption associated with the generation of electricity used by HP products** | 45,280,000 | 39,820,000 | 38,100,000  |

* Methodological updates to improve the accuracy of our carbon footprint calculations also impacted calculations in the water consumption associated with the generation of electricity used by HP products category. Data for 2022 and 2023 are restated. See Carbon Footprint for detail. Additional details on calculations and methodology can be found in the HP Water accounting manual. Indirect water consumption from inkjet and soarjet printers that HP manufactures for sale and service by other original equipment manufacturers is excluded from our water footprint. Water consumption from the manufacturing of these printers of HP-operated facilities is captured in the direct water consumption data reported in this year's report.

* In some cases, segments do not add up to total due to rounding.
** Historical energy intensity values were calculated using HP's annual revenue as characterized in financial reporting and energy use.
*** Diesel is mostly used at HP for testing generators. In limited cases, diesel is also used for long-term on-site energy generation.
Δ Data not reported prior to 2022.
† Renewable energy and RECs, excluding renewable energy provided by default in the power grid.
†† "Water withdrawal" includes municipal water, wastewater from another organization, rainwater, and well water. Water withdrawal does not include reused treated sewage treatment plant water. In the GRI framework, municipal water and wastewater from another organization are classified as third-party water.
††† NEWater is ultrapurified wastewater used in manufacturing operations in Singapore.
* This water was used historically for landscaping and toilets.
*** Historical water withdrawal intensity values were calculated using HP's annual revenue as characterized in financial reporting and water withdrawal.
*** Includes NEWater (ultrapurified wastewater used in manufacturing operations in Singapore) as well as recycled or reused water reported by sites globally. Graywater is included; rainwater is not.
