# Reporting Concerns

All employees and third parties can ask questions and report ethics concerns via an online form: global, local, 24-hour toll-free phone lines (available internally and externally) with translation; text messaging (in the US); and mail; as well as in person. We offer anonymous reporting options where permitted by law. At any time, employees can also reach out to their manager or another leader under HP's Open Door Policy, seek advice from internal ethics and compliance experts, or consult Internal Audit, the HP People organization, Integrity at HP Country teams, or Integrity at HP liaisons. HP does not tolerate retaliation against anyone who raises a concern or question. If the risk of potential retaliation is sensed, the Integrity Investigations team will follow up with the source and ensure there has been no retaliation.

# Investigating Concerns

Suspected violations of Integrity at HP damage trust in our company. We take all alleged violations seriously, ensure responses are timely, and take disciplinary or remedial actions when appropriate, including coaching, verbal warnings, written warnings, and termination. Serious violations may impact an employee's Total Rewards package (subject to local labor laws and where legally permissible).

Once an allegation or concern has been submitted through one of our reporting avenues, the complainant receives an acknowledgment from the case management tool with an access number and password that can be used to check the status of their concern. The Integrity Investigations team performs an initial evaluation and review to assess whether the allegation is employee related, and whether it should be investigated as an Integrity matter or referred to the appropriate business unit or function for handling.

During an investigation, the complainant may be contacted by a member of the Integrity Investigations team for additional information. If the concern was reported anonymously, a request for additional information will be made through the case management tool. Once the investigation has concluded, a confidential investigation report is drafted, including proposed recommendations. This report is then sent to the relevant review team for approval and the complainant is informed when the investigation has concluded. The timeline for investigating concerns is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the type of allegation, the complexity of the matter, and relevant whistleblowing legislation.

Allegations are investigated by a dedicated global Integrity Investigations team. When appropriate, Employee Relations Investigators from the People Organization (and occasionally country leads from our Legal, Controllership, and People organization teams) may also conduct Integrity investigations. Our investigation process monitors employee compliance with Integrity at HP and other relevant policies and continues to evolve with improved resources and technology to promptly respond to concerns and perform investigation-related functions in house. Additionally, our global case management tool enables us to identify emerging trends in ethics violations and assess where additional controls may be needed.
