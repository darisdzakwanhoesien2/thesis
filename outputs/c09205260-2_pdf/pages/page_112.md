# Mitigating Conflict Minerals Risks in Our Supply Chain

Promoting smelter best practices is one of the most direct ways that we proactively address the potential risk of conflict minerals entering the supply chain. We require our suppliers to source 3TG for HP products only from smelters that actively participate in a recognized third-party assessment program, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)'s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), or from 100% recycled sources. Presence on the RMI conformant list indicates the smelter or refiner in is good standing through a continual validation process and that it has systems and processes in place to support responsible sourcing.

We designed our due diligence measures to conform with applicable portions of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (Third Edition, OECD 2016) and the related Supplements, which is an internationally recognized due diligence framework. The design of these measures account for HP's downstream position in the minerals supply chain, the OECD recommendations for downstream actors that have no direct relationships to smelters or refiners, and the use of independent assessment programs to provide information about smelters or refiners.

Our relatively small use of these metals limits our influence, and so we encourage all industries that use these materials to demand responsible sourcing of 3TG. We will continue to work with our suppliers and industry groups to drive demand for responsible sourcing of minerals, regardless of origin.

We promote responsibly sourced minerals in our supply chain by:

- Requiring our production suppliers of goods containing 3TG ("3TG suppliers") to require their smelters to undergo third-party assessments or use recycled materials.
- Encouraging all smelters that purchase and process mineral ores to participate in independent third-party assessments.
- Supporting multi-stakeholder collaboration to establish secure, ethical 3TG sources worldwide, including the CAHRAs and the DRC and its surrounding countries.

# 3TG Suppliers

HP sets clear requirements of 3TG suppliers in our Supply Chain Social and Environmental Responsibility Policy (which includes our policy toward conflict minerals), GSE, and Supplier Code of Conduct.

We assess these suppliers' responses using the RMI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), which offers companies a common format for sharing information about 3TG sources with business partners and suppliers across the supply chain. We require corrective action from suppliers where needed and provide them with training on an annual basis or upon request.

If any 3TG supplier reports sourcing from a smelter that triggers one of our potential risk indicators, we work with the supplier to establish whether unverified material is potentially used in HP products. When we identify a risk of this occurring, we first communicate our expectations through the supply chain to encourage the smelter to participate in a third-party assessment program. If such efforts are not successful, we require the supplier to investigate alternative sources for the minerals that a 3TG smelter could source responsibly. If a supplier is non-responsive, we leverage our procurement influence to drive accountability.

# Smelters

To identify and disclose the smelters and refiners in our supply chain, between January and December 2024, HP surveyed suppliers that contributed material, components, or manufacturing for products containing 3TG. Each smelter or refiner reported was identified in at least one of the RMI CMRTs we received.
