## HP LIFE: Learning and Employment Opportunities

To help accelerate digital equity and build skills for the future, the HP Foundation provides core business skills training free of charge for students, entrepreneurs, and lifelong learners all over the world through HP LIFE. Accessed online via the HP LIFE platform, in person through our world-class partners, or via the HP LIFE app, the program provides opportunities for individuals to learn in-demand skills and core business concepts, expand their digital literacy, start a business, or secure a better job.

HP LIFE offers global access to more than 30 free courses in eight languages. In 2024, we launched four new courses: Effective Leadership, Resume Writing and Interviewing, Introduction to Cybersecurity Awareness, and Agile Project Management. All courses are compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1.

Additionally, offline capabilities now exist via the HP LIFE mobile app. Learners can download offline courses, learning when they do not have a connection. This mobile app enhancement expands our ability to reach new learners around the world, particularly in areas where connectivity is limited.

## Advancing Economic Opportunity in Costa Rica

HP employees across locations are passionate about using their time and skills to give back to their communities. In Costa Rica, one of the many ways employees take action is by delivering skills training programs. Through a public/private partnership between the Government of Costa Rica, the Foundation for Sustainability and Equality (ALIARSE) Foundation, and HP, volunteers utilized HP LIFE course content to train underrepresented entrepreneurs through classes (Growth Mindset, Data Analysis, Design Thinking, and Effective Presentations) during a 9-month program, resulting in a total of 5,541 course completions.

More information can be found on the HP LIFE website.

## Disaster Recovery and Resilience

HP, our employees, and the HP Foundation together provide financial support for communities affected by natural disasters and emergencies.

In 2024, we continued to give disaster relief funding, assisting those affected by earthquakes in Japan and China, wildfires in Chile, and flooding in Brazil and Central Europe. We also provided support for those affected by the Israel-Hamas war, among other initiatives. HP employees donated US$210,794—which was matched by the HP Foundation with US$252,342—for a total of US$463,136 provided to 102 global organizations that assist in disaster preparedness and relief.

HP Foundation is a member of the American Red Cross's Disaster Responder Program, a partnership that supports disaster relief by investing in emergency preparedness resources before they are needed. During the year, we worked with strategic partners, including the American Red Cross, and other local in-country Red Cross chapters.
