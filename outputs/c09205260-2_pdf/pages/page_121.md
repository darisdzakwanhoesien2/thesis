2024 Sustainable Impact Report

Overall, two-year average audit scores have increased. From 2022 to 2024, the percentage of production supplier initial audits and full re-audits that scored above 160 increased from 49% to 63%. The average score during that period increased from 137 to 161. 24 audits during 2024 were of final assembly supplier sites. Of these, 67% scored over 160, 33% scored between 100 and 160, and 0% scored under 100. The other 148 audits during 2024 were of commodity supplier sites. Of these, 63% scored over 160, 32% scored between 100 and 160, and 5% scored under 100.

During the year, 172 initial audits and full re-audits of production suppliers identified 945 other priority and major nonconformances, equivalent to 5.5 per audit on average.[10] Six provisions (see table below) out of 47 total represented 61% of all major nonconformances identified. We focus on these and other areas that have the greatest potential for improvement with Corrective Action Plans as part of our due diligence in ceasing, preventing, and mitigating adverse impacts.
