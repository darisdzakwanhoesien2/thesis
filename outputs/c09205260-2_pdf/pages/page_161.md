|  Schedule of Supply Chain Audits, Assessments and Findings for the year ended October 31, 2024  |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Indicator name | Scope | Reported value | Criteria  |
|  Supplier audits and assessments completed, including percentage Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAR) audits | Global | In 2024, we completed 332 audits of production, nonproduction, and product transportation suppliers, and 34 other assessments of production suppliers. During the year, 86% of production supplier audits were third-party certified RBA VAP audits. | Production suppliers provide materials and components for product manufacturing and also assemble HP products. Product transportation suppliers provide services for the shipping and delivery of HP products. Nonproduction suppliers provide goods and services that do not go into the production of HP products (such as staffing, telecommunications, and travel). Audits of production suppliers, product transportation suppliers, suppliers supporting HP manufacturing, and HP manufacturing sites follow the RBA Code of Conduct Audit Protocol 7.1.2, or 8.0. Initial Audits that started after July 2023 used RBA Protocol 7.1.2 and Initial Audits that started after January 2024 used RBA Protocol 8.0. HP also participates in the RBA VAP, which uses independent external auditors to audit suppliers' social and environmental responsibility performance against HP Supplier Code of Conduct requirements. The number of audits reported includes those that begin during the reporting year and for which the audit report is received by November 19th of the subsequent fiscal year (e.g., received by November 19, 2024 for reports conducted during FY24). For FY23, the number of audits reported included those that begin during the reporting year and for which the audit report is received by February 15th of the subsequent fiscal year (e.g., received by February 15, 2024 for reports conducted during FY23). Audit reports received after this date are included in the following year's reported value. Other assessments include health and safety assessments, onboarding assessments, vulnerable worker group (student and foreign worker) assessments, Key Performance Indicator (KPI) validation assessments, and priority screening assessments.  |
|  Production supplier audit finding rate for major nonconformances and priority findings | Global | 172 initial audits and full re-audits of production suppliers conducted in 2024 identified 3 immediate priority findings, equivalent to 0.02 per audit on average, and 945 other nonconformances^{13}, equivalent to 5.5 per audit on average. | Immediate priority findings are the most serious type of supplier nonconformance and require immediate action. These would include any priority nonconformances (as defined by the RBA VAR) identified related to the following topics: child labor, forced labor, severe forms of discrimination, health and safety issues posing immediate danger to life or risk of serious injury, perceived violation of environmental laws posing serious and immediate harm to the community, and falsified pay slips. Other nonconformances include all other priority nonconformances and all major nonconformances as defined by the RBA VAP.  |

13 Other priority nonconformances and major nonconformances represent 3.3% and 96.7% of other nonconformances, respectively.
