# Tracking and Implementing Results

We monitor and evaluate our suppliers in multiple ways to understand performance, identify and address issues, and drive ongoing progress.

Suppliers representing 95% of HP's total production supplier spend have undergone social and environmental monitoring. This equates to around 58% of HP's production supplier sites being monitored.

Our approach to supplier monitoring and evaluation includes:

- Supplier Scorecards: We use Supplier Scorecards to measure and incentivize supplier performance on a range of factors, including audit results and other performance metrics. Learn more.
- Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs): We conduct SAQs, which include detailed questions about social and environmental management and practices and are based on our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). Learn more.
- LaborKPI Monitoring Program: We collect data weekly from high-risk supplier sites on key issues such as working hours, days of rest, and student workers. This data supports our supplier collaboration efforts to drive ongoing improvement. See results.

- Supplier Audits: Our supplier audits—both announced and unannounced—measure conformance with all provisions of the HP SCoC in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics, and management systems. Learn more.
- Additional Assessments: Alongside our audit program, we identify and manage human rights risks efficiently and effectively with a wide range of assessments. Learn more.
