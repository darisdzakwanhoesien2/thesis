# Green Buildings and Facilities

When feasible, we pursue green building certifications at HP-owned and leased properties to ensure our buildings meet industry-leading standards for energy efficiency, sustainability, and environmental performance. These certifications play a critical role in advancing our energy goals by reducing energy consumption and contributing to the overall decarbonization of our built environment. In addition, energy-efficient buildings help to minimize operational costs, improve occupant well-being, and enhance resilience against climate impacts. As of 31 October 2024:

- 14 sites globally have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certifications for buildings, including 13 at the Gold level or above.¹⁵
- Three sites have achieved Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) certifications for building, including two at the Excellent level.¹⁶
- One location has achieved SITES certification for sustainable landscaping.
- One site has achieved Total Resource Use and Efficiency (TRUE) certification for waste diversion.

To provide better guidance to our project managers for the buildout of our facilities, we developed the Sustainability Playbook: Construction and Design for project managers, outlining key principles such as energy efficiency, indoor air quality, water conservation, and waste management. All new construction projects are targeted to meet the LEED® v4 Gold standard or an equivalent local certification, such as BREEAM. In our site selection process, we also incorporate environmental considerations by using the HP Energy and Sustainability Survey to ask prospective landlords about features like LEED® certification, renewable energy, EV charging stations, and water efficiency.

By the end of 2024, 21 facilities, including all HP-owned manufacturing sites, were certified to ISO 14001:2015 (the most recent version), with 17 as part of our global ISO 14001 certificate. 12 facilities, including 50% of HP manufacturing sites, were certified to ISO 45001:2018 for occupational health and safety as well.

# Auto Fleet, Business Travel, and Commuting

Our goal is to reduce GHG emissions from HP-owned or leased auto fleet vehicles by 25% by 2025, compared with 2015.

During 2024, our company auto fleet accounted for 17,700 tonnes of CO2e missions, 2.1% less than in 2023 and 42.3% less than in 2015.

By 2030, our goal is to achieve a 100% electric vehicle (EV) company fleet. We started our first EV fleet pilots in the Netherlands in 2020 and have since introduced EV choices in 17 countries. By the end of 2024, our fleet comprises 20% EV and 29% hybrid vehicles.

To support the growing adoption of EVs, we are committed to installing EV infrastructure at all feasible sites worldwide by 2030. As of 2024, we have implemented EV infrastructure at 46 of our 77 target sites (60%). Additionally, we ensure that new building constructions and lease agreements include provisions for EV infrastructure whenever possible.

To mitigate the environmental impact of business travel, we implemented a comprehensive strategy that includes offering employees low-emission travel options through partnerships with travel providers. By utilizing advanced travel planning tools, we help employees make informed choices that align with HP's sustainability goals. Where possible, we promote virtual collaboration by encouraging the use of video conferencing and other digital platforms to replace in-person meetings, significantly reducing the need for travel. These efforts are part of our broader commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and fostering a culture of sustainability within our organization.

In 2021, we joined the Eco-Skies Alliance program to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF™), demonstrating our dedication to sustainable innovation in corporate travel. This commitment remained strong in 2024 as we increased the intensity of SAF use in our business travel. Approximately 5,480 tonnes of CO2e out of 57,079 tonnes of CO2e from our business air travel footprint were represented by our SAF purchases. Our participation in this program highlights HP's focus on impactful collaborations that promote a greener future for the travel industry.
