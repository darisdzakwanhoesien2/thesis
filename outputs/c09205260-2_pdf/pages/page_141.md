# Compensation and Benefits

HP offers a comprehensive Total Rewards package that is both performance-based and market competitive. Total Rewards includes salaries, bonuses, incentive programs, and a range of benefits designed to meet our employees' diverse needs while enhancing employees' and their families' well-being.

Most non-sales employees are eligible for HP's performance bonus. Funding for the HP bonus program is linked to company financial performance, and individual bonus payouts are based on employee performance. HP also offers equity to eligible non-officer employees based on contributions to the company. The purpose of HP's equity program is to strengthen employees' alignment to company goals and encourage their focus on creating long-term value for stockholders.

Valuing and rewarding employees drives higher engagement and better performance. Compensation and benefits are reviewed periodically for market competitiveness.

Benefits programs vary by country to reflect local market practice and employee needs. Depending on location, these may include:

- Retirement and savings plans.
- Healthcare benefits.
- Mental health support.
- Insurance protections (e.g., life and disability).
- Time-off programs (e.g., vacation, holidays, parental leaves, injury/illness).
- Discount programs.
- Flexible work arrangements.
- Stock purchase plans.
- Other benefits.

# Pay Equity

We believe people should be paid equitably for their work, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on relevant market data, and consider factors such as an employee's role, experience, and performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, in terms of both our overall workforce and our individual employees, to make sure our pay is fair and equitable.

Since 2016, HP has reviewed employees' compensation with the support of independent third-party experts to ensure equitable pay practices. We continued our annual pay equity assessment in 2024, evaluating 18 countries with our largest employee populations, which represent 88% of our global workforce. The independent analysis determined there were no systemic issues.

In cases where pay differences are identified and a reason in line with our compensation practices cannot be determined, pay adjustments are made. To maintain equity, we will continue to perform these reviews at least annually.

True to our cultural principles and business strategy, our aim is for HP to be regarded as a leader in providing all employees with fair and equitable pay. We are committed to regularly evaluating our approach to employee compensation, conducting reviews of our practices, and making timely and appropriate adjustments to individual employees' pay as needed.

# Executive Compensation

The HR and Compensation Committee discharges the HP Board of Directors' responsibilities related to the compensation of our executives and directors, and it provides general oversight of our compensation structure, including our equity compensation plans and benefits programs. See page 71 of the HP 2025 Proxy Statement for details.

In accordance with US SEC rules, we recently reported our CEO pay ratio for 2024. Our CEO's annual total compensation for 2024 was US$19,360,127. Our median employee's annual total compensation was US$69,571, resulting in a CEO pay ratio of 278:1. For more detail, including our calculation methodology, see page 84 of the HP 2025 Proxy Statement.
