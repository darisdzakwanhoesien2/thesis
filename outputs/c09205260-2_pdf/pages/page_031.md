# Recycled Content

HP is both a supplier and a user of recovered materials, incorporating recycled and recyclable content⁸¹ into new HP products where possible. Our aim is to help accelerate the global market for recovered and recycled materials and to support progress toward a circular economy.

More than 99% of HP home and office printers, desktops, notebooks, displays, and workstations shipped to customers in 2024 included recycled materials. Additionally, HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays are derived from recycled or renewable sources. HP has used over 1 billion pounds of recycled materials in HP products and packaging since 2019.

# Recycled Plastic Use

## 2025 GOAL

Use 30% postconsumer recycled content plastic across HP's personal systems and print product portfolio by 2025.⁶⁶

## 26%

achieved, a total of 48,840 tonnes of postconsumer recycled content plastic during 2024.

# Plastic

Plastic waste has become a global problem shown to cause harm to ecosystems and potentially leads to negative human health effects. Every year, up to 23 million tonnes of plastic waste leak into waterways and can break down into microplastics that may harm wildlife and enter the food chain.⁶² Due to these issues, we focus on substituting plastic packaging (where feasible) with more sustainable materials, increasing use of recycled plastic, using ocean-bound recycled plastic, and offering take-back and recycling services.⁶³

In 2024, HP used 48,840 tonnes of postconsumer recycled content plastic in HP products, equivalent to 26% of overall plastic use. For personal systems, we increased our use of postconsumer recycled content plastic from 27% to 30%. See the Data table for details.

Since 2016, HP has worked to increase use of ocean-bound plastic in our products. Through partnerships with NGOs and key suppliers, we've supported the establishment of ocean-bound plastic removal infrastructure that has enabled us to incorporate 2,876 tonnes of recovered ocean-bound plastic into our products globally—the equivalent of keeping nearly 226 million 500 ml single-use plastic bottles out of waterways.⁶⁴ More than 450 HP products now contain ocean-bound plastic.

Starting in 2016, we partnered with The First Mile—an initiative of the NGO WORK—and our supplier partners to build a self-reliant ocean-bound plastic supply chain in Haiti that contributes to the circular economy and provides local income and education opportunities. These efforts have also helped to provide employment opportunities, access to healthcare, and family education support to our workers. In addition, we have created educational hubs, equipped with HP hardware and printed materials, which have positively impacted local children by providing access to quality education.

In 2024, HP partnered with multiple recycled material suppliers to activate an ocean plastic supply chain, repurposing waste streams such as expanded polystyrene (EPS) and discarded fishing nets into products. Ocean plastic has been incorporated into new products like the HP EliteBook 1040 G11, all certified to the UL2809 standard.

To drive change across and beyond our industry, we also collaborate with a range of initiatives and organizations. For example, NextWave Plastics convenes leading technology and consumer-focused companies to develop the first global network of ocean-bound and ocean plastic supply chains. HP is also a partner and funder of The Circulate Initiative's Responsible Sourcing Initiative, which aims to create an actionable global standard for responsibly sourcing recycled plastics. HP was the brand partner for implementation of the framework in Vietnam. See the Human Rights section for more information.

## +335M

pounds of recycled materials were used in HP products and packaging in 2024.⁶⁵

# Metal

Metal plays an increasingly important role in our approach to circularity, especially because metals make up a large portion of the materials in our personal systems and print products. We continue to expand the use of recycled metal in our products.

We source metals with a high proportion of recycled content for some personal systems products, including up to 90% recycled aluminum, up to 90% recycled magnesium, up to 20% recycled steel, up to 50% recycled copper, and at least 25% recycled indium. These metals are designed to be as recyclable as virgin metals through existing infrastructure and still meet the demanding industrial design requirements of our products. Use of recycled metals decreases environmental impacts associated with mining and producing virgin materials, including energy use and associated GHG emissions. During 2024, our use of recycled metals in personal systems products increased by 54%, compared with the previous year.

# Glass

Glass is used in many of HP's products including: display panels, scanners, and as a filler to strengthen plastics. In 2024, HP Series 5 Pro 24,25 contained at least 20% recycled glass.

We are working with our glass suppliers to increase recycled glass applications. In 2024, HP launched the first recycled glass fiber design in a product: the HP convertible laptop stand.
