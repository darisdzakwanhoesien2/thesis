# Sustainability Materiality

To continuously inform our Sustainable Impact strategy, we conduct periodic sustainability materiality assessments. Understanding our actual and potential impacts on the environment and society, as well as risks and opportunities for our company, enables us to determine our policies, commitments, actions, and progress. These assessments also inform our ambitious goals.

We completed a sustainability materiality assessment in early 2024. To design our process, we borrowed concepts from international standards and regulatory frameworks and intend for this assessment to describe where HP stands in relation to major sustainability topics.

Throughout the 2024 HP Sustainable Impact Report, we use the definition of "materiality" from concepts borrowed from international standards and regulatory frameworks related to sustainability. This definition is different from the term as it has been defined by or construed in accordance with securities laws or any other laws of the US or any other jurisdiction, or as used in the context of our financial statements and financial reporting, or our reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Topics identified as material for the purpose of this report should not be construed as being material for SEC or other reporting purposes, financial or otherwise.

## Our Assessment Process

We developed a four-step process to identify and assess actual and potential sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities.

### Context

We built a shared vision of success, gathered key materials and stakeholders, and developed an overview of the organization's sustainability context.

### Identify

We identified actual and potential sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities—which were categorized by type, time horizon, geography, remediability, and other factors—before reviewing with stakeholders.

### Assess

We drew on desktop research and stakeholder engagement to assess sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities. Throughout the evaluation, we were intentional in not considering HP's current performance and HP's impacts relative to other industries or companies.

### Consolidate

We consolidated the outputs of the assessment, which serve as a helpful input to our continual evaluation of the Sustainable Impact strategy in the context of our overall business strategy. This consolidation helped HP see potential areas to explore for strategic focus.
