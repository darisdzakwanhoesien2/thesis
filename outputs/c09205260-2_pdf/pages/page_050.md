# Worldwide Security and Analytics Practice

Our Worldwide Security and Analytics Practice, led by HP's chief information security officer, advances security within our business units and products, and collaborates with customers and clients. Priorities include:

- Leading efforts to educate employees and clients about cybersecurity, conducting related risk assessments, establishing baselines, and creating cybersecurity roadmaps for HP and our clients.
- Driving alignment with regulatory and compliance requirements such as HIPAA, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and various other privacy laws.
- Coordinating our client-facing Security Advisory Board, which includes our chief information security officer among its members.
- Facilitating and participating in customer cybersecurity incident response and customer cybersecurity events as needed and as requested.
- Collaborating with HP's printing business units on our Bug Bounty program.

# Certification, Audits, and Assessments

The Cybersecurity Organization regularly conducts audits of HP cybersecurity systems and performs annual risk assessments of related HP systems and processes, including our information security management systems (ISMS). To ensure secure process operations, the Organization also drives third-party risk assessments into our procurement process.

Our risk-based Information Security Management System (ISMS) maintained International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001 certification during 2024, assuring that HP meets the international standard for information systems security. We commission external independent assessors to conduct an annual National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework assessment. Details on the certification of HP services and systems to recognized industry standards can be found on our website, and include:

- ISO/IEC 27701:2022 Information Security Management certification.
- ISO/IEC 20243:2018 Supply Chain Security certification.
- System and Organization Controls (SOC2) Type II and SOC3.
- Secure Development Practices Assessment Certification (SD-PAC).

HP has completed the self-certification under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US DPF, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.

The Worldwide Security and Analytics Practice audits HP as a customer, as well as HP's customer-facing cybersecurity systems, and conducts annual risk assessments of related systems and processes to help establish baselines and drive improvement in cybersecurity postures.

# Incident Response

We employ formal processes to address cybersecurity events associated with our worldwide client base, including customer support and mechanisms to escalate issues as needed.

Our online Security Bulletins support our commitment by providing prompt notification and remediation of any vulnerabilities related to our products, services, and solutions. When incidents occur, the Cybersecurity Organization and the Worldwide Security and Analytics Practice respond swiftly, reporting activities to relevant leadership. When a potential cybersecurity event is identified, a core team is responsible for managing the event, including any commercial or legal obligations to notify our customers and/or make regulatory filings. If the potential cybersecurity event involves personal data, HP's Trust and Privacy Organization is engaged as well.

Discussion of data breaches associated with such cybersecurity events can be found in the Complaints, Breaches, and Requests section of the report.
