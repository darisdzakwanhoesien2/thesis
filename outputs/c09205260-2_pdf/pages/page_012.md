Impact Report

# Examples of stakeholder engagement in 2024 included the following, with additional information available throughout the report:

## Empower Customer Sustainability

- To discuss the pivotal role public policy plays in driving progress toward a more sustainable and circular economy, we engaged key trade associations like the Chamber of Commerce, American Chamber of Commerce ELL, the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, the Information Technology Industry Council, and the Consumer Technology Association, as well as international entities like the World Economic Forum and the United Nations.
- HP has joined industry peers in advancing circular design through the Circular Electronics Partnership with the Circular Electronics Design Guide. As a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Network, we collaborate to make the circular economy a reality.

## Transform HP's Value Chain

- We engaged in initiatives focused on increasing support for clean energy and combating climate change, including the Responsible Business Alliance, Clean Energy Buyers Association, RE100, EV100, Carbon Disclosure Project's Supply Chain membership, Business Ambition for 1.5°C, and Center for Climate and Energy Solutions' Business Environmental Leadership Council.
- We engaged in multi-stakeholder collaborations, including the Responsible Business Alliance, the Responsible Minerals Initiative (appointed to the Steering Committee), the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (the Advisory Committee of funding new pilot projects),

the Responsible Sourcing Initiative (actively supporting the recycling space), Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, and Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) Human Rights Working Group (driving progress and elevating human rights best practices).

- We are committed to taking collective action to protect workers in our global supply chain from exposure to hazardous process chemicals—as one of three initial Founding Signatories of Clean Electronics Production Network's (CEPN) Toward Zero Exposure program.
- Building on our commitment as a founding sponsor of Catalyze with Schneider Electric, we are actively engaging in the program to drive meaningful decarbonization across the semiconductor and IT supply chains.
- We cross-checked supplier sites representing 95% of our spend against the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs (IPE)'s public database of environmental violations. Certain first-tier suppliers also provided information about sub-tier supplier compliance with local environmental laws. This review of over 922 sub-tier suppliers against IPE's public database of environmental violations identified 63 issues in 2024. Of these, 32 had been corrected as of November 2024, and we continue working with the relevant first-tier suppliers and IPE to assess, address, and resolve the remaining issues.

## Advance Societal Impact

- We engaged with nonprofits embedded in disconnected communities through HP's Digital Equity Accelerator, providing them with monetary grants and resources to bridge the digital divide. We collaborated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MIT Solve to address equity challenges through social entrepreneurship, and our work with the YMCA created economic opportunity for young people by helping them develop the skills they need.
