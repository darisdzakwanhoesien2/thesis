# Our Mission

Minimizing total environmental impact requires intentional action and innovation beyond the design of HP's product offerings. Thus, we pursue continuous improvements to sustainability, responsibility, and resilience by leading efforts across our value chain and in the communities where our technology is deployed, including through supplier partnerships and human rights due diligence (HRDD).

We take decisive action to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations, manage our water footprint, and invest in responsible management of forests. In addition to improving our impact on the environment and society, these efforts provide advantages for our business, customers, and partners.

While greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from HP operations only represent 2% of our footprint, we work to demonstrate leadership in emissions management, reduction, and disclosure. Our global operations produced 127,600 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e emissions during 2024, a 13% decrease compared with 2023.

Our production and nonproduction suppliers play a crucial role in helping us reduce carbon emissions. Because 98% of our emissions occur in our value chain, we use our scale and scope to engage closely with suppliers on improvement opportunities. We encourage suppliers to address their own impacts, such as by using renewable electricity. For over a decade, we have collaborated closely with our production and nonproduction suppliers to strengthen their environmental initiatives and to ensure transparent progress reporting, focusing on GHG emissions and energy use, water withdrawal, and waste generation.

HP always acts with integrity. Everyone at HP is expected to meet the highest ethical standards and to treat others with respect and fairness. A strong dedication to our values underpins our efforts, reinforced by in-depth training and communication and upheld through targeted policies and strong governance. We require ethical conduct from our suppliers and partners, and we use our scale and influence to drive progress across the IT industry. See Operating Responsibly.

When it comes to human rights, our stance is clear and uncompromising. We believe in advocating for universal rights within HP and beyond, and we drive policies that advance fundamental dignity and respect. We monitor emerging human rights expectations and best practices to ensure that our program is continually adapting and improving, and we are committed to supporting the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human
