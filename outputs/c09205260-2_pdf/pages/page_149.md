# Our Communities

HP actively engages with leading industry organizations and conferences to promote inclusive representation in technology and engineering.

## Broadening Representation in Technology

Organizations and conferences we engage with include:

- Disability:IN.
- Information Technology Senior Management Forum (ITSMF).
- National Association of Multicultural Engineering Program Advocates.
- National HBCU Business Deans Roundtable.
- National Society of Black Engineers.
- Out &amp; Equal.
- Professional BusinessWomen of California.
- Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.
- Society of Women Engineers.
- Hispanic Technology Executive Council.

Our long-standing partnerships help us attract talent with diverse backgrounds and experiences, drive professional development, bring innovation for our customers, and make an impact in the community.

In 2024, HP continued its partnership with SWE CPC membership, a strong presence at the WE23 National Conference, and multiple individual award recognitions. HP hosted four speaker sessions, an information session on emerging technologies, and celebrated four SWE award winners and 13 patent awardees.

HP participated in AfroTech 2024 with programming designed to support and elevate HP's Black/African American technologists through executive panels, innovation showcases, and community-building events. The conference provided employees with opportunities to engage in technology deep dives, network, and explore leadership pathways—reinforcing HP's focus on innovation and inclusive career growth.

HP works to inspire more women and members of racial/ethnic minorities to consider science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. For example, we support organizations such as Girl Rising and blackcomputeHER. Our BRGs also host community events and partner with nonprofits such as Hiring Our Heroes, Hour of Code, and local Pride organizations.

We also partner with HBCUs to increase the representation of Black/African American engineers in the high-tech workforce. In 2024, we continued our HBCU Partnership Program, which includes an on-campus engagement plan with Prairie View A&amp;M University, Texas Southern University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, Morgan State University, Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Clark Atlanta University.
