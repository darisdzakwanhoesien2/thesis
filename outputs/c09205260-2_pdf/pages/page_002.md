# Letter from Our President and CEO

We believe the future of work should drive growth for companies and fulfillment for employees. At HP, we have a powerful opportunity to do both while serving as a force for good in the world.

This vision is grounded in our values of integrity, trust, and an unwavering commitment to people and the planet. These principles are the HP Way: a legacy of responsible business practices that has shaped our journey for decades and continues to guide us forward.

As a global company operating in over 170 countries, we bring these values to life wherever we do business. We focus on creating lasting impact in the communities we serve and helping prepare the next generation for what's ahead.

That is why sustainability is embedded in what we do—from how we innovate, to how we operate, to how we engage with our communities. It is not a separate initiative, but a core element of our strategy to grow responsibly and create lasting value for all our stakeholders.

## Our Progress and Impact

We are making measurable progress. Across our environmental and societal goals, we are seeing results and advancing on many fronts. We have now reached 100% renewable electricity in our U.S. operations, reflecting our continued progress toward a net-zero future.

Through our digital equity programs, we have reached 65 million people since 2021—opening doors to education and economic advancement around the world. This work is essential to unlocking opportunity for future generations and creating a workforce ready for what's next. This includes our partnership with YMCA. Since 2022,

we have partnered to establish more than 320 Digital Hubs across 14 countries, reaching more than 700,000 people.

Yet the real impact goes beyond numbers. These figures represent students discovering new possibilities, job seekers gaining critical digital and AI skills, and families connecting to opportunity. This is the heart of our societal impact—helping prepare the next generation for the future of work by expanding access to education, technology, and support systems people need to thrive.

It is a powerful reminder that behind every data point is a human impact—and that's what motivates us to keep going.

## Delivering Value Through Sustainability

Our overall progress continues to be recognized. EcoVadis—a leading global sustainability ratings provider—awarded HP a platinum medal for the 15th consecutive year, placing us among the top 1% of companies worldwide.

Building on this impact, we are empowering our customers to create positive business value while reducing their environmental footprint. We are helping companies utilize innovative technology as more than a productivity tool but a fulfillment platform, grounded in our belief that technology can help companies deliver growth and fulfillment.

At the same time, we are transforming our value chain to embed sustainability and strengthen resilience across our global operations and supply chain.

Together, these efforts are driving meaningful change—empowering people, strengthening systems, and opening doors to a more inclusive,

sustainable future of work. As we look ahead, we will continue to build on this momentum, committed to a future that delivers opportunity, purpose, and resilience for everyone.

I am deeply grateful to our employees, partners, and communities around the world for sharing this commitment. Your dedication and collaboration are what make our progress possible.

Solutions,
