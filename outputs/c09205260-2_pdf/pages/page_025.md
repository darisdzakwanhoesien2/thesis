# Circularity

At HP, we embrace the principles of the circular economy by prioritizing sustainable material choices, circular design, and the repair, recovery, and reuse of our products. From the design stage to the product's final usable life, this approach reduces the need for new resources and ensures that our products remain in circulation longer, all in support of our goals.

According to the United Nations, e-waste is one of the world's fastest-growing solid waste streams. In 2022, nearly 137 billion pounds of e-waste were generated globally, with only 22% formally collected and recycled. HP is in a unique position to help address this issue, and we have implemented company-wide circularity practices and metrics across our products and packaging. We aim to advance circular economy principles by minimizing our reliance on finite resources, maximizing the value and lifespan of our products, and reducing waste across our value chain.

We also offer a wide range of services focused on repairing, recovering, reusing, and recycling our products to extend their life at their highest value possible to reduce end-of-use impacts. We build our products to last, including repairability and upgradeability. When a device fails, we offer easy-to-access repair services to extend product life.

HP aims to support the industry's transition to a circular economy through practical and scalable circularity solutions. As a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network, HP engages with a large multi-sector collective of global leaders to exchange ideas and drive change.
