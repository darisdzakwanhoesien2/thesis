# Safety Across HP Printing

Original HP Toner and Ink Cartridges are designed and tested with indoor air quality in mind. We voluntarily design and test our printing systems™ to meet Blue Angel and EPEAT® indoor air quality emission standards.

## Home and Office Printing Solutions

In 2024, HP commissioned the Fraunhofer Institute's Wilhem-Klauditz-Institut (WKI) to perform studies that tested the emission rates of volatile organic compounds. The WKI examined 50 non-HP toner cartridges sold as alternatives for popular HP printers. These tests were carried out in compliance with Blue Angel DE-UZ 219 and conducted on cartridges sold in North America; Latin America; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific and Japan (AFJ) regions. The study found that 70% of non-HP toner cartridges failed Blue Angel emission criteria and may therefore contribute to poor indoor air quality.¹⁸

## Large Format Printing

The water-based formulation of HP Latex Inks provides a more comfortable and welcoming print-production environment without sacrificing performance.

HP Latex Inks consist of up to 65% water and are designed to avoid the hazards associated with alternative inks. They contain zero hazardous air pollutants,¹⁷ are nonflammable and noncombustible,¹⁸ and avoid problematic reactive monomer chemistry.¹⁹

For our textile-printing solutions, which include HP Stitch printers, HP conducts a hazard and regulatory assessment for each substance in the ink formulation to determine its suitability for the application. We also obtain the ECO PASSPORT by OEKO-TEX®, an independent safety certification for chemicals and colorants used in the manufacturing of textiles, which supports customers who wish to obtain the OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100 certification for their textile products.

Additional information can be found in Product Certifications and Documentation.

## Industrial Print

We incorporate relevant food-contact material regulations, industry guidance, and brand requirements into our formulation qualification process. These steps support a variety of food packaging-printing solutions offered by our Indigo, PageWide Industrial, and Specialty Printing Systems technologies. Whenever possible, HP strives to formulate with chemicals previously evaluated and deemed suitable for use in food packaging-printing applications.

## 3D Printing

For our 3D-printing solutions, we conduct a hazard and regulatory assessment for each substance in the fusing and detailing agent formulations to meet worldwide regulatory requirements and address a broad range of health and environmental considerations.

To help meet customers' sustainability requirements, we also review formulations against restricted substances lists as required by individual customers. HP 3D printing materials HP 3D HR PA 11, HP CB PA 12, HP 3D HR PA 12 enabled by Evonik, HP 3D HR PA 12 W, HP 3D PA 12 S enabled by Arkema, HP 3D HR PA12 GB, HP 3D HR PP enabled by BASF, and HP 3D HR TPA enable by Evonik, as well as the corresponding HP 3D 600/700/710 and HP 3D 710R/710W Fusing and Detailing Agents, have been tested for regulated heavy metals, phthalates, and bisphenol A.
