# Supply Chain

HP works with our production suppliers to measure, report, and reduce HP-related waste. Our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) requires both compliance with waste management regulations as well as the responsible handling, recycling, and disposal of waste.

We encourage our production suppliers to use the Responsible Business Alliance's RBA-Online to report waste data. We work with suppliers to promote zero-waste-to-landfill standards and work to achieve waste-related certifications like UL 2799 and TRUE.

During 2023, the most recent year for which production supplier waste data is available, our suppliers generated 209,400 tonnes of nonhazardous waste associated with HP, a 31% increase from 2022. Key factors included an increase in spend on commodities with a high waste impact such as Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) panels as well as improved reporting from our suppliers. Suppliers reduced the amount of generated hazardous waste associated with HP by 28% in 2023 as compared with the prior year, generating a total of 50,600 tonnes. This variation was partly due to improved reporting of hazardous waste data by a strategic supplier. By the end of 2023, 71% of our production suppliers, by spend, had set waste-related goals.

As of the end of 2024, nine final assembly sites and 15 commodity sites had achieved Zero Waste Certification.
