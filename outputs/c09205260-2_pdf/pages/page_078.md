Impact Report

# Efficient Paper Consumption

Addressing HP's impact on forests begins with product R&amp;D and service innovation. Our printers and product software are designed to minimize paper waste, helping customers save automatically.

Examples include:

- 70% of HP's laser portfolio are duplex capable and are defaulted double-sided printing out of the box.³⁸
- ~99%¹⁰,³⁰ of HP's laser portfolio have pull-printing features enabled, which requires users to be at the printer for the job to be released, reducing unclaimed print jobs and misprints by an estimated 10-30%.³²
- Non-HP brand toner cartridges are found to use 42% more paper³⁴ due to reprinting and inconsistent print quality, compared with Original HP toner cartridges.
- The HP Smart app includes file scanning and sharing, allowing users to digitize records in lieu of printing.
