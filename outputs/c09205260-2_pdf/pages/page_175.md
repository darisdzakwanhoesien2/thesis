## Transform HP's Value Chain continued

11 About GHG emissions data: This report includes Scope 1.2, and 3 GHG emissions data from HP's operations, transportation fleet, and employee business travel, calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute (WRI). See the HP 2024 carbon footprint for more details and on overview of emissions across the value chain.
- Scope 1 emissions include those from the direct use of natural gas, gasoline, diesel fuel, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), pit fuel, refrigerants, and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) in operations and from fuel used by HP's transportation fleet.
- Scope 2 emissions are primarily from purchased electricity used in HP's operational real estate.
- Scope 3 emissions reported in this section result from employee business travel by commercial airlines and from commuting.
- Data in this section for 2022-2024 uses the market-based method. In the data summary, we also include 2022-2024 data using the location-based method.

12 HP's climate risk assessment and other policies have been refreshed after the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) submission in July 2024.

13 This updated goal was validated by SBTI.

14 As applicable, HP uses WCC on Canada and the US, GCIs in most European countries, and IRECs in most Asian countries and other countries not covered by RECs and GCIs.

15 Depending on the project, our sites may achieve certification for LEED* for Building Design and Construction (LEED 001-C), LEED for Interior Design and Construction (LEED 001-C), or LEED for Operations and Maintenance (LEED 0144) Least more.

16 This includes BREEAM International Refurbishment and Fit Out (RFO), Least more.

17 Check United Airlines GRE program website for more information.

18 Intensity is calculated as the portion of first-tier production and product transportation suppliers' reported GHG emissions attributable to HP, divided by HP's annual revenue. This method normalizes performance based on business productivity. Intensity is reported as a three-year rolling average to decrease the impact of variance year-over-year and highlight longer-term trends. Production supplier GHG emissions include Scope 1 and Scope 2.

19 HP estimates supplier GHG emissions avoided based on supplier-reported energy savings from specific energy-efficiency projects (compared with projected energy use without those projects) and supplier use of zero emissions energy. These energy data are converted into GHG emissions avoided using emission factors for electricity and fuel types. These data also include estimates of product transportation-related GHG emissions avoided, related to specific initiatives to improve product transportation efficiency. Data include supplier reporting through 2023, the most recent data set available.

20 This continues a goal from before the separation of Hewlett-Packard Company on 1 November 2015, extending the goal to 2025, includes data from suppliers associated with HP Inc. and HP Inc. pre-separation business units.

21 HP estimates supplier GHG emissions avoided based on supplier-reported energy savings from specific energy-efficiency projects (compared to projected energy use without those projects) and supplier use of zero emissions energy. These energy data are converted into GHG emissions avoided using emission factors for electricity and fuel types. These data also include estimates of product transportation-related GHG emissions avoided, related to specific initiatives to improve product transportation efficiency. Data include supplier reporting through 2023, the most recent data set available.

22 See HP's total water footprint data here.

23 Goal is to reduce potable water withdrawal in global operations by 35% by 2025, compared with 2015, focusing on high-risk sites.

24 US Geological Survey (USGS) definition of water consumption used by HP - water that has been permanently removed from the immediate water environment through processes such as evaporation, transpiration, or incorporation into products or crops.

25 Direct consumption data for HP operations are based on site meter readings, utility invoices, or estimated data using an HP calculated intensity factor. For estimations, calculations are based on internal analysis of water consumption intensity (liters per square feet) for each region and occupancy status. HP used 2023 intensity factors for 2024 water calculations.

26 Water stress refers to the ability or lack thereof, to meet the human and ecological demand for water. Water stress can refer to the availability, quality, or accessibility of water. HP uses the WRI Aqueduct tool to assess water stress.

27 All Water (ultrapurified wastewater used in manufacturing operations, landscaping, and groynwater plumbing in Singapore) is currently our only recent source.

28 Water discharge and/or evaporation rates are estimated. Upon receiving all invoiced water withdrawal and discharges and performing estimations on the withdrawn water to fill in gaps, the average rate of discharge for those rates with invoice and full levels of discharge and/or the rate is not 100%, is calculated. The sites comprising the average rate of discharge are reviewed for reasonableness of inclusion. The discharge rate is applied to all sites in the portfolio.

31 Based on unique number of products offered in the LaserJet Pro and Enterprise portfolio shipped in 2024.

32 All Enterprise products support server-based Full or Personal Identification Number (PIN) released print; select Pro and Laser products support physical honteens based PIN number released print.

33 Typical of these reported by leading industry analysts and HP client engagements. Estimated energy and paper savings based on analysis of select HP Managed Print Bar sizes (MPB) customers' imaging and printing operations using data gathered on devices and paper consumption and comparing with post-MPE actuals or projections. Results depend on unique business environments, the way HP products and services are used, and other factors. Overall printing costs are unique to each company and should not be relied on for savings achieved.

34 2024 North America Four Elements Consulting LCA study, commissioned by HP, compared Original HP SBA toner cartridges with six brands of non-HP toner cartridges across eight environmental impact categories. See www.HP.com/go/NA LCA nonHP 202.

35 Packaging is the low first comes with the product and all paper-based materials inside the box. Packaging for commercial, industrial, and 3D products, scanners, personal systems accessories, and spare parts is not included.

36 Wood was added to the commitment in 2019 due to wood now being used in some HP products.

45 Excludes new hires joining HP after 1 January 2024 (although all new hires are given 30 days to complete integrity of HP New Hire training as part of their mandatory onboarding process).

46 These include child labor, forced labor, severe forms of discrimination, health and safety issues posing immediate danger to life or risk of serious injury, and perceived violation of environmental laws posing serious and immediate harm to the community. We take such findings and curricula and require suppliers to cease all-related practices and report corrective actions taken within 30 days of the original audit. Recruitment fees must be reimbursed within 90 days of discovery, which is verified by an on-site inspection within 180 days of discovery. We follow up closely to ensure that all required corrective actions are completed and visit sites to confirm resolution. Immediate priority findings do not necessarily involve termination of the supplier; we work with suppliers as appropriate to improve their performance and worker conditions in these areas.

47 The term "forced labor" refers to situations in which people are coerced to work against their will, either overtly through violence or intimidation, or by more subtle means such as accumulated debt, retention of identity papers, and threats of denunciation. HP forbids any forced, bonded, or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons within its supply chain and operations.

48 Control of overall 'referral' to the internal precursors of the metals (antidans, tin, tungsten, and gold (2TS) as defined in the US Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring a conflict minerals disclosure. Reserves from mining these minerals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries has been widely linked to funding for groups engaged in extreme violence and human rights atrocities.

49 The term "unreal labor" refers to situations in which people are coerced to work against their will, either overtly through violence or intimidation, or by more subtle means such as accumulated debt, retention of identity papers, and threats of denunciation. HP forbids any forced, bonded, or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons within its supply chain and operations.

50 "Confidentiality" refers to the internal precursors of the metals (antidans, tin, tungsten, and gold (2TS) as defined in the US Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring a conflict minerals disclosure. Reserves from mining these minerals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries has been widely linked to funding for groups engaged in extreme violence and human rights atrocities.

51 Immediate priority findings (three in 2024) include child labor, forced labor, severe forms of discrimination, health and safety issues posing immediate danger to life or risk of serious injury, and perceived violation of environmental laws posing serious and immediate harm to the community. Prior to 2025, we reported other priority nonconformances and major nonconformances together as major nonconformances. Starting in 2020, to more fully align with WBA Protocol 6.5 estimates of the HP began distinguishing other priority nonconformances from major nonconformances and referring to these as "other nonconformances." In 2019, the WBI other nonconformances identified included other priority nonconformances (2% of the total) and all major nonconformances (81% of the total), as defined by the WBA Protocols 7.01, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13 and 8.0.
