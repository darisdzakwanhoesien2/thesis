Transform HP's Value Chain | Operating Responsibly

2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Ethics

To maintain an ethical workplace, we prioritize policies, training, programs, and channels to report concerns. Conducting business with purpose and integrity is integral to our mission and, in 2025, we were recognized by Ethisphere as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies* for the sixth consecutive year.

# Training and Communication

Our employee code of conduct, Integrity at HP, pertains to our conduct within the company and our conduct involving customers, channel partners, suppliers, and competitors.

Mandatory annual Integrity at HP training covers the key policies, procedures, and high-risk issues employees might face, incorporating scenarios based on actual investigations. In 2024, this training included content on HP's culture, raising concerns, anti-corruption (with additional content for employees in sales, finance, government relations, partner-facing, and public sector roles), conflicts of interest, accurate business records, ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI), anti-retaliation, and sexual harassment. Managers receive additional content applicable to their role. The 12 members of HP's Board of Directors and our CEO received Integrity at HP content relevant to their positions and confirmed review.

Additionally, through Integrity Central, employees can access a library of ready-to-use material on key ethics topics, including toolkits, posters, infographics, training materials, and scenarios. Regular training, newsletters, virtual coffee talks, and communications campaigns reinforce the values of Integrity at HP and keep ethical practices top of mind throughout the year. In 2024, we added Integrity Moments (bite-sized custom videos on various topics for team sharing) to our library.
