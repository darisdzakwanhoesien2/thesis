# Circular Design

Design is an important part of circularity because it directly influences how products are made, used, and disposed of. Product research and development (R&amp;D) represents 5% or less of a product's total cost, but it impacts up to 80% of the product's overall environmental impact.⁴⁴ By designing products and services with circularity in mind, HP considers the full lifecycle of products.

More than 30 years ago, HP established what is now known as Design for Circularity, which guides the design and development of our products. Our program uses a science-based approach to evaluate our products, identify and prioritize improvement opportunities, and set goals. Our design prioritises focus on incorporating recycled and renewable materials and incorporating safer chemicals, as well as designing our products for durability, repairability, reusability, and recyclability. HP also provides services that enable product repair, reuse, and recycling. Our service design is continuously improved not only to enhance our repair, refurbishment, and recycling operations, but also to include customer feedback, thereby enhancing their experience.

As an active member of the Circular Electronics Partnership (CEP), HP collaborated to establish the Circular Electronics Design Guide to share knowledge with the electronics industry for transitioning to circularity. Additionally, HP's design and development processes for personal computing, laser jet, and inkjet products are certified under ISO 14001, which is designed to help companies reduce environmental impact. HP has also provided comments to the technical committee of the ISO 59000 series, specifically designed to foster a shift towards a circular economy. Through industry collaboration, as well as our own product design and development, we remain committed to our role in advancing the circular economy.
