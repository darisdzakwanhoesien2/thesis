# Production Suppliers

Our Supplier Scorecard is a key engagement tool designed to encourage our production suppliers to adopt environmental best practices. Through comprehensive training, we communicate our environmental expectations to a wide range of suppliers, including those responsible for final assembly, high-GHG-impact commodities, and the production of our personal systems, print hardware, and printing supplies. Since 2018, we have utilized the Scorecard to promote renewable energy sourcing and to encourage suppliers to establish validated science-based targets for reducing GHG emissions. This practices ensures that their climate action goals align with our own ambitions.

In 2024, we extended our efforts beyond our own supply chain by collaborating with other organizations to drive cross-sector improvements. Through a collection of HP initiatives since 2010, we estimate that program participants have cut over 2.17 million tonnes of CO2e emissions since 2010, achieving our goal to help suppliers cut two million tonnes of CO2e emissions between 2010 and 2025.²¹

- CDP Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Corporate Questionnaire: Through HP's CDP Supply Chain membership, we contributed to developing the CDP Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Corporate Questionnaire, which launched in 2024. Created in partnership with the SME Climate Hub, this initiative allows HP's smaller suppliers to engage with CDP, increasing awareness and transparency about their environmental impacts while accelerating their climate action efforts.

- EPEAT® eco label: Since 2021, we have actively contributed to the development of new standards anticipated to impact our printing and personal systems products. The EPEAT Climate+ criteria, first introduced in May 2023, continue to evolve. We remain closely engaged in this process, recognizing the potential of these standards to drive transformative changes across the IT industry by addressing critical issues such as supply chain GHG emissions, water use, and waste management.

- The Catalyze program: Building on our commitment as a founding sponsor of Catalyze, we are actively engaging in the program to drive meaningful decarbonization across the semiconductor and IT supply chains. Led by Schneider Electric, the Catalyze program fosters collaboration among industry leaders, providing participants with training on renewable energy sourcing and localized market guidance. Through our participation in this initiative, we are empowering suppliers to commit to decarbonization and facilitating their access to large-scale Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) through collective buyer cohorts, enabling smaller suppliers to participate in the transition to renewable energy.

In 2024, we continued to prioritize capacity building by partnering with leading third-party companies to provide targeted training on climate science-based targets and other climate-related issues.

- Science-based target workshops: Since 2023, HP has partnered with leading companies across industries to provide training for suppliers on GHG accounting, climate science, and science-based targets for near-term reduction, net zero, and forestry land and agriculture (FLAG).

- CDP disclosure and best practices webinar: We collaborated with CDP to deliver online and recorded training aimed at helping HP suppliers understand our Sustainable Impact goals, the CDP disclosure process, and expectations for climate change and water security reporting. This webinar was offered in both English and Mandarin to 224 of the production suppliers requested to respond to CDP through our CDP Supply Chain membership.

- HP Supplier Carbon Workshops: HP's sustainability and procurement teams engaged directly with 47 high-impact suppliers through individual meetings. These sessions communicated HP's sustainability goals and specific requirements, emphasizing the importance of GHG reduction targets, increased renewable electricity usage, and implementation of energy efficiency and zero-waste management systems.

In 2024, 55% of HP's production suppliers reported having science-based targets, with 49% validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI) and 6% assessed by HP.

Through HP's push for suppliers to adopt renewable energy, 94% (by spend) reported in 2023 that they are using renewable energy and 71% reported having renewable energy goals.
