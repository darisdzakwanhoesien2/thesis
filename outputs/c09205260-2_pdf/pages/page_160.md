a Direct energy use refers to direct energy consumption in operations or facilities within HP's operational control, including natural gas, renewable energy generated on-site, diesel/ol/gas/Liquified Petroleum Gas, and transportation fleet, including vehicles and air, similar to the Scope 1 emissions boundary. Refrigerants and perfluorinated compounds are not applicable to the calculation of direct energy use, although they are included in the Scope 1 GHG emissions boundary.
Note that 1 MWh equates to 3,600 megapules
b Indirect energy includes purchased electricity and steam consumed within operations or facilities within HP's operational control and does not include renewable energy purchases.
Voluntary purchases of renewable energy include the purchase of unbundled renewable energy credits (RECs), participation in utility green power programs and renewable energy contracted through energy providers.
Direct water withdrawal for HP operations includes water withdrawn for use in operations or facilities within HP's operational control and includes: 2,000 cubic meters of captured rain water (classified as surface water); 0 cubic meters of well water (classified as ground water); and 2,248,000 cubic meters of municipal water and NeWater, which is wastewater sourced from another organization (both of which are classified as third-party water). Note that sewage treatment plant (STP) water is not included within the scope of water withdrawal. Seawater and produced water are not applicable to HP. De-watering wells are present at HP's Corvallis, OR site to manage water tables for structural purposes by withdrawing naturally occurring groundwater to repurpose for irrigation or to return to local surface bodies of water through storm drains. Groundwater withdrawn through de-watering wells at the site is excluded from the water withdrawal amount reported due to the lack of data available to measure or estimate. Note that the groundwater is considered non-potable water.
11 Note that 1 cubic meter of water equates to 0.001 megabions.
