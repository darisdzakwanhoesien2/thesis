Impact Report

# Stakeholder Engagement

We gain valuable insight into our Sustainable Impact strategy through regular engagement with a range of internal and external stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, peer companies, policymakers, industry bodies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and sector experts.

Stakeholders are identified based on factors such as expertise, willingness to collaborate, reputation, location, sphere of influence, and ability to scale and accelerate progress. These interactions build our collective intelligence, help us prioritize critical issues, and provide insights into emerging opportunities and risks. Individual functions across the company engage with stakeholders in ways that are most relevant to their objectives and operations, including partnerships, sponsorships, collaboration on industry initiatives, customer and supplier education, supplier capability building programs, supplier audits and assessments, conference participation, employee surveys, and mentoring.

Some forms of stakeholder engagement follow a set frequency, such as our annual employee Voice Insight Action survey, yearly responses to rating/ranking questionnaires, and supplier audits. Other forms of engagement, including responses

to customer requests for information about our Sustainable Impact performance, collaboration with NGOs and industry peers on specific issues, and discussion with policymakers, occur on an ad hoc basis.

We also conduct annual outreach regarding our governance profile with stockholders, which most recently included stockholders representing around 35% of our outstanding stock. Topics discussed include HP's strategy and business performance, governance practices, executive compensation, and Sustainable Impact.
