# Repair, Refurbish, and Reuse

Keeping our products in use for as long as possible is critical to enabling a low-carbon circular economy. HP offers a wide range of reliable and flexible solutions to extend the life of our devices.

## Repair

In addition to designing our products for easy repair, HP enables customers to repair their purchased products themselves or to choose one of our HP services.

Free service documentation, service options, and extended warranties are available for most HP products through HP Care Pack Central.

## Self-Repair

HP has invested in improving our customers' abilities to successfully repair their own products. Our Self Repair website, HP Support YouTube channel, and Parts Store offer support for product setup, troubleshooting, and repair.

## HP Support Services

For customers needing additional support, HP offers offsite and onsite support, with expert technicians providing device repair services with HP Support Services.

## Refurbish and Reuse

HP Renew Solutions represent our commitment to reducing environmental impact by giving devices another life, supporting the circular economy. These solutions are designed to support the transformation of our industry and to help customers meet their sustainability goals.

- Device Life Extension: Prolongs device usage through refurbishment, manages transitions within organizations, and helps reduce refresh cycles.
- HP IT Asset Disposition (ITAD): Compliant recovery of used devices, ensuring they are securely data-sanitized and enabled for reuse, to avoid e-waste.
- HP Certified Refurbished Hardware: Reliable refurbished devices that come with a one-year limited warranty, with an option to extend up to three years.

Additionally, the HP Certified Refurbished Partner Licensing Program focuses on creating synergies with leading organizations in the refurbishment industry to standardize refurbishment practices and to ensure high-quality, reliable HP hardware for customers with an HP Warranty.

To ensure that all refurbishment and reuse solutions meet HP standards for quality, vendors providing reuse, refurbishing, and remarketing services must follow the requirements of the HP Hardware Reuse Standard. The process includes compliance with the NIST SP 800-88 standard for media sanitization. To promote transparency and drive social environmental standards in the electronics industry supply chain, we publish a detailed list of our reuse vendor sites, which is updated annually.

Additionally, the HP HOPE program collaborates with NGOs and non-profits to donate refurbished HP computers to young people from vulnerable communities.
