# Salient Human Rights Risks

Once HP's human rights risks are assessed, we prioritize efforts by focusing on our salient human rights issues across our global footprint—those vulnerable to the most severe negative impact to rights-holders through our activities and business relationships. This human rights due diligence comprehends the severity and likelihood of potential and actual adverse impacts on stakeholders, whether direct or indirect.

Risk identification, assessments, programs, and activities are regularly updated with new information throughout the year to adapt priorities and to continually improve our HRDD program. Throughout the process, we concentrate on the risks to people over those faced by the company.

In 2024, through our most recent human rights risk assessments, impact assessments, risk identification, and stakeholder engagement and analysis process, we identified HP's salient human rights risks—those warranting heightened due diligence—including:

- Modern slavery, particularly forced labor and child labor in different business contexts.
- In our operations, the risk of modern slavery is predominantly associated with the non-manufacturing suppliers supporting our offices (e.g., janitorial, facilities, and security) and our HP-managed manufacturing operations.
- In our supply chain, the risk of modern slavery is predominantly associated with manufacturing suppliers operating in countries where there is a high volume of foreign migrant labor and a lack of legal protections and/or enforcement of protections for migrant labor.
- In our more distant upstream and downstream value chains, the risk of forced labor and child labor is predominantly associated with materials sourcing, such as minerals or waste collection. In these instances, we align our practices with the relevant portions of international guidance, such as the OECD's guidance on responsible minerals, and we work with other companies to build leverage with intermediate actors deep in the supply chain. Tackling the risks in these sectors requires industry collaboration, as no single organization can address these systemic challenges alone.

- Disproportionate use of force by security workers related to workers rights.
- All security personnel on HP manufacturing sites complete Supplier Code of Conduct training. Learn more in Capability Building and Training.

- Discrimination.
- Learn more about HP's Supplier Inclusion Program, aimed at promoting inclusion in our supply chain. A more diverse supplier base is rooted in our core values and is crucial for driving innovation, supply chain resilience, and supporting local communities.

- Product misuse.
- To avoid the misuse of our products and solutions, we comply with relevant sanctions, restrictions, and embargoes imposed by national governments or international organizations across our worldwide operations. Throughout our business, we prioritize the highest standards of corporate ethics, and we operate in strict accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

These findings are consistent with broader industry risks, experience, and expectations, and HP's approach is continually evolving to account for known and emerging issues.
