^ To provide additional transparency, this report presents used electronic equipment recovered from HP operations as a separate category.
^^ Reduced and reused waste materials are included in the Recycled category.
B We reuse electronic equipment when possible or recycle it responsibly through the same programs we offer customers. See Repair, Refurbish, and Reuse.
BP HP sites report nonhazardous waste volumes and disposition based on information provided by our waste-disposed vendors. For sites unable to track nonhazardous waste directly, we estimate volumes and disposition using intensity factors based on similar operations.
BW Includes glass and mixed recycling.
BMW includes all waste not sent to a municipal solid waste or recycling facility. This conservative approach classifies all waste managed by our hazardous waste vendors as hazardous, unless we definitively determine it to be nonhazardous and dispose of it accordingly.
B HP collects all refrigerant consumption data from local facilities' maintenance teams company-wide, directly accounting for facilities' refrigerant leakage and use, and avoiding the need for extrapolation. We use various tools and sources for global warming potential and ozone-depletion values, including the Greenhouse Gas Protocols GHG Emissions from Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Equipment tool and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment Report (1995).
