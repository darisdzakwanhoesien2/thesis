# Forests

As a company that believes the future of work delivers growth and fulfillment through technology, we are dedicated to improving our forest ecosystem impacts. Nature-based solutions, such as sustainable land management and forest protection and restoration, can provide 37% of the climate change mitigation needed through 2030 to achieve Paris Agreement targets.²⁹

HP has long-established collaborations with preservation and conservation Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to help us identify, prioritize, implement, and monitor our forest conservation impact. Through collaborations like these, HP is investing in the protection, restoration, and improved management of forests around the world.

In 2024, HP continued our commitments to globally important forests through our work with World

Wildlife Fund (WWF), Conservation International, and the The Arbor Day Foundation. We also maintained our commitment to responsibly source fiber for all HP-brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays. To support our goals, we focus on acting across three areas: (1) efficient paper consumption, (2) responsible sourcing, and (3) nature-based solutions.
