# Incident Remediation

HP's value chain HRDD consists of identifying and assessing actual and potential adverse impacts on human rights, and, when possible, implementing measures to cease, prevent, or mitigate any actual and potential adverse impacts.

We track and assess allegations of potentially adverse human rights impacts that are brought to our attention through the formal grievance process or outside of it (such as through audits, assessments, or the media), and we take appropriate actions promptly where allegations are confirmed. Our goal is to ensure a consistent and effective response to incidents, safeguarding human rights across our value chain.

In 2024, we received a total of 668 formal contacts through our grievance mechanism (which is open to everyone). No grievances were associated with modern slavery risk or child labor in our own operations or supply chain.

During our Human Rights Incident Management Process, once we are aware of a potential incident or allegation, a case manager is assigned and an investigation takes place. The scope of an investigation is usually narrow and limited to a specific aspect of our operations, a supplier, or a specific location. The approach involves a combination of desk research, document review, and stakeholder engagement, particularly with potentially affected stakeholders. Management is informed of and updated on incidents on a monthly basis. All high-risk incidents are immediately escalated to management.

# Addressing Modern Slavery

In 2024, ten suppliers, located in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, were found to have nonconformances associated with indicators of modern slavery. Six of those suppliers charged fees prohibited by HP's Supplier Code of Conduct and the Supply Chain Foreign Migrant Worker Standard, including recruitment, passport renewal, and medical fees. Two suppliers charged fees and withheld personal documentation, one supplier was found to have practices creating a risk of debt bondage, and one supplier was found to have restriction of movement, all in violation of the HP SCoC and the Supply Chain Foreign Migrant Worker Standard.

Through our partnership with the RBA, HP immediately addressed each of these ten cases using our established process. We required suppliers to reimburse all recruitment and related fees previously borne by workers, cease the prohibited practices, revise their foreign migrant worker recruitment policies to guarantee that workers will incur no recruitment or placement costs going forward, and transparently communicate these policy enhancements to their workforce. Once suppliers confirmed completion of the corrective actions, HP and the RBA coordinated third-party verification of the total number of affected workers and oversaw the full reimbursement of fees. In 2024, this remediation process delivered confirmed remedies for more than 1,100 workers—totaling over US $1.56 million in fee repayments. Since 2018, HP has successfully remediated over 11,000 workers, with supplier repayments exceeding US $8 million.

# MillionMakers Implementation Plan

The MillionMakers program enables suppliers to identify and address site-specific gaps in collaboration with HP. At one participating site, key findings included limited awareness of grievance mechanisms and possible restriction of movement. In response, the supplier implemented improvements including providing dedicated refresher briefings on available policies, updating a poster on Human Rights policies, and conducting internal trainings on RBA Code of Conduct to supervisors of the factories. A follow-up assessment was requested by the supplier to evaluate progress and remaining challenges. While the results showed increased worker confidence in responding to the survey, they also revealed persistent or new gaps in areas such as abuse of vulnerability in restriction of movement and possible deception. HP supported the supplier's response plan, which included town hall sessions to clarify human rights policies and a long-term training roadmap covering topics like freedom of association and ethical reporting.

Based on MillionMakers survey results, HP approved an implementation plan in 2024 with a key supplier in Malaysia to address identified issues, particularly around wage transparency and access to grievance mechanisms. HP's Global Responsible Sourcing team collaborated with the supplier to define actionable steps and realistic timelines aligned with international labor standards. The supplier committed to and began implementing the following actions:

- Delivered education sessions on policies and worker rights.
- Trained supervisors on balancing safety protocols with workers' freedom of movement.

- Enhanced communication of grievance mechanisms to ensure workers can report concerns confidentially.

The supplier has also initiated town hall meetings and updated posters on Human Rights policies to provide clearer communication and clarify key gaps identified in MillionMakers (i.e. restriction of movement, grievance mechanisms).

# Stakeholder Engagement

In our remediation process, stakeholder engagement plays a crucial role in understanding, addressing, and resolving adverse impacts effectively and transparently. We actively engage with diverse stakeholders, including workers, suppliers, industry partners, and NGOs, to ensure that our approaches to grievance handling and remediation align with the needs of those affected by our operations and supply chain practices. This engagement fosters a collaborative approach to addressing issues and promotes accountability across our network.

As a member of the RBA, we have access to shared industry resources, which is especially valuable in situations where multiple customers may be involved with the same supplier. RBA membership allows us to participate in collective grievance mechanisms, leverage the RBA's tools for risk assessment, and support corrective actions that may benefit multiple stakeholders across the industry. This shared approach enhances our ability to address grievances that may not directly originate from HP but require our involvement due to our connection to the supply chain. Our involvement with RBA also strengthens our influence in promoting systemic improvements that benefit all affected parties, including workers, by aligning with best practices supported collectively by our industry.
