# Stakeholder Engagement

Our commitment to stakeholder engagement helps ensure that our human rights practices are robust, transparent, and responsive to the needs of rights-holders affected by our operations and supply chain. By grounding our approach in open dialogue and continuous feedback, we strive to make meaningful contributions toward advancing human rights across our business and industry through continuous improvement. Internal and external stakeholders inform every step of our HRDD approach. Due to the global and diverse nature of HP's operations and value chain, engagement with stakeholders is both direct and indirect.

- Identifying and Assessing Risks: Stakeholders inform our risk identification of human rights concerns and emerging issues. Regular, proactive consultations with industry associations, employees, suppliers, consultants, and NGOs allow us to anticipate risks, particularly within vulnerable areas of our supply chain as well as broader industry risks. For example, industry associations have been essential to identifying regions with higher risks of forced labor or gender discrimination through their worker and supplier interviews and surveys. This step has enabled us to focus preventive efforts where they are most needed. Learn more.

- Ceasing, Preventing, and Mitigating Risks: Once risks are identified, we collaborate with stakeholders to develop targeted mitigation strategies and to assess the effectiveness of those strategies. We design and refine our program to better address priority issues and, where possible, to implement collaborative industry solutions for greater impact. In 2024, consultations with suppliers and industry partners led us to enhance training programs on modern slavery throughout our supply chain. Learn more.

- Remediation and Access to Remedy: Ensuring that affected individuals have access to remedy is a cornerstone of our human rights commitment. In partnership with civil society organizations, we continue to develop processes that facilitate safe and transparent resolution of any rights-related concerns raised by workers, suppliers, and community members. We engage directly with rights-holders to understand what concerns they have, and we create feedback loops within the supply chain to inform them of activities arising from their feedback.

- Tracking and Communicating Progress: Stakeholder input is vital for tracking the effectiveness of our human rights initiatives. Updates and outcomes are shared across the HP network—including suppliers, customers, investors, and the public—ensuring that stakeholders are informed on progress and can provide feedback to drive continuous improvement. HP tailors language and terminology appropriately so that information aligns with each audience's needs, motivations, and concerns. The Global Responsible Sourcing team is multilingual (English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Malay, and Spanish, among others), allowing accessible and constructive engagement with new and complex concepts in different regions to be more easily and effectively communicated. This skill set is essential for meaningful engagement that builds trust, enhancing both connection and comprehension. Learn more.
