# Independent Accountants' Review Report

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of HP Inc. We have reviewed HP Inc.'s ("HP") accompanying schedules of select sustainability information (the "Subject Matter") included in Appendix A and as presented in HP's 2024 Sustainable Impact Report for the year ended October 31, 2024 in accordance with the criteria also set forth in Appendix A (the "Criteria"). HP's management is responsible for the Subject Matter in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.

Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from and are substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed. As such, a review does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.

We are required to be independent of HP Inc. and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our review engagement. Additionally, we have complied with the other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of Professional Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. Our review consisted principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the Subject Matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

As described in Appendix A, the Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.

Furthermore, Scope 3 emissions are calculated based on a significant number of estimations and management assumptions due to the inherent nature of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard as well as the Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions criteria.

The information included in HP's 2024 Sustainable Impact Report, other than the Subject Matter, has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our review and, accordingly, we express no conclusion on it.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying schedules of select sustainability information for the year ended October 31, 2024, in order for the schedules to be in accordance with the Criteria.
