# Employee Development

Human capital development underpins our efforts to transform and grow HP. We aim to be known for the innovators that we inspire and develop, as much as for the innovations that we create and deliver.

HP's employees' talent, ambition, and diverse perspectives fuel HP, and we are investing in career growth opportunities through our long-term business strategy. Our objective is to attract, retain, and nurture the exceptional leaders of tomorrow, to comprise a wide range of workforce skills, and to create a robust pathway for talent development. We believe that our future success is dependent on creating an environment where our employees have opportunities to develop their potential and achieve their career ambitions.

Priorities include:

- Developing an inclusive pipeline of high-performing, skilled leaders equipped to grow our business.
- Future-proofing the organization's skills with relevant training and experiences.
- Modernizing how we find and develop internal talent.
- Enabling employees to develop and grow their careers.

# Inclusive Bench of Future Ready Leaders

We develop future executive leaders through targeted talent strategies and an executive development portfolio based on data insights from our talent planning and assessment process. 2024 initiatives included:

- Regular executive talent conversations that provided a forum for senior leaders to prioritize talent development at the enterprise level, ensuring a strong pipeline of leaders with varied perspectives. Our aim is to drive an integrated talent management and development approach that incorporates rich experiences and exposes leaders to external educational opportunities in business schools and universities, leadership assessments, executive coaching, job rotations, and immersive experiential learning programs. Core to these experiences are interactions with HP's most senior leaders, including the HP Board of Directors. In 2024, over 100 executives participated in these leadership development opportunities.
- A key priority has been the development of our director level leaders through Propel, a face-to-face immersive development workshop experience with six months of formal executive coaching. The objective is to equip directors to scale their leadership impact and accelerate personal growth.

- To develop management acumen, new programs included Feedback Skills for Managers and Coaching Foundations for Leaders. Our objective is to equip people managers with enhanced skills that enable team members to maximize performance, grow and develop, and achieve their career goals. This development was scaled to all managers through a series of blended learning offerings, including live in-person, live virtual, and self-paced. Additional toolkits and resources are available to people managers to support their development, including a 360-degree leadership assessment, coaching to accelerate leadership impact and personal growth, and team development tools to enhance collaboration and effectiveness.
- Over 400 new people managers developed skills through the HP New Manager Development Journey. The year-long program features a portfolio of experiences including coaching, immersive scenario based simulations, and toolkits. Our objective is to equip new managers with the tools to lead and develop high-performing teams, coach for performance, and champion inclusion.

Further, we prioritize the development of emerging talent by offering participation in an extensive array of internal and external development programs designed to accelerate career growth. In 2024, over 430 employees participated in development opportunities that were most relevant to their career aspirations. These opportunities included:

- HP Catalyst: A year-long program designed to accelerate the careers of key talent through peer learning, coaching, and sponsorship.

- Advancing Executives: A multi-week interactive cohort-based program focused on professional branding, networking, mentors, and sponsorship for career acceleration.
- Formal coaching: A six month coaching engagement with an external executive coach. The objective is to create and implement strong personal development plans.

Additionally, some participants were invited to a regional career empowerment and networking conference, where they participated in career development workshops and met with hiring managers and recruiters to explore their career aspirations.

HP also sponsors employees' and leaders' participation in external leadership development programs, such as the Information Technology Senior Management Forum (ITSMF), the Executive Leadership Council (ELC), World 50, and the McKinsey Academy leadership programs for executives and managers. Additionally, we invest in providing greater access to professional organizations, such as the Society of Women Engineers.
