# Improving Supply Chains Through Industry Collaboration

Because HP has a global supply chain, we work with industry groups and collaborate with peer companies to provide training on topics that impact many organizations. Collaboration helps ensure that universal standards for expectations are being communicated, and it reduces supplier fatigue by not undertaking repetitive courses required by multiple customers. Together, we can create greater impact and improvement in mitigating human rights risks on a wider scale.

Some of the collaborative training efforts we engaged in during 2024 include:

- **Process Chemicals**: We are committed to taking collective action to protect workers in our global supply chain from exposure to hazardous process chemicals as one of the three initial Founding Signatories of Clean Electronics Production Network's (CEPN) Toward Zero Exposure program, which was developed with sustainability and social responsibility leaders. Through the program, electronics brands and suppliers commit to aligned, structured, long-term practices that will protect workers throughout the manufacturing process from exposure to potentially hazardous chemicals. Several facilities have established the Joint Worker Management Chemical Safety and Health (CS&amp;H) Committee to create opportunities for workers to engage in promoting workplace safety related to chemical management, involving around 21,000 workers in production. In 2024, we began working closely with CEPN and other industry partners to develop the Process Chemical Safety Training. Through this training, both managerial staff and workers track to ensure that the training developed is targeted toward the correct audience. Process Chemical Safety Training will serve as a capability building training for industries that involve process chemicals,

as well as part of due diligence approach for battery suppliers in conjunction with Battery Due Diligence laws. See CEPN's Toward Zero Exposure report for more information.

- **HRDD**: In collaboration with other technology peers (HPE, Intel, and Seagate, Western Digital) and RBA, we delivered a training that included three deep explorations of human rights topics. This training was designed to help prepare suppliers for new HRDD regulations, comparing HRDD laws in the EU with the RBA Code of Conduct. The training informed participants of effective grievance mechanisms and responsible recruitment practices, and it also provided a detailed explanation of GHG emissions, focusing on Scope 3 emissions. Around 1,130 representatives of HP suppliers attended, benefiting from documentation and existing toolkits.

- **Human Rights Risks in Logistics**: We prepared a training in collaboration with two of our member organizations, Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT) and the Mekong Club, as the logistics industry has an association with unique human rights risks. The training's goal was to build awareness, trust, and support from internal logistics supplier managers.

HP measures the effectiveness of our value chain training through interactive quizzes, polls, and surveys to evaluate participants' understanding and gather feedback. Our aim is to ensure that suppliers who attend our training have a greater awareness and understanding of human rights topics.
