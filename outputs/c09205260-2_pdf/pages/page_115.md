# Recycling and End of Life

While vital for sustainability efforts, the recycling industry presents significant human rights risks, particularly for vulnerable workers involved in waste collection and processing. Many of these workers are in the informal sector and face hazardous working conditions, low pay, and a lack of protection for risks such as child labor and guaranteeing workers' rights. In regions with limited oversight, these risks are heightened, with potential exposure to unsafe working environments, exploitation, and health hazards due to poor safety standards and limited access to protective equipment.

To mitigate these human rights risks, it is essential that workers involved in recycling activities, particularly in the informal sector, are treated with dignity, and that their livelihoods are protected. Tackling the complexities of these risks in the recycling sector requires industry collaboration, as no single organization can address these systemic challenges alone.

To proactively engage and support improvement in this space, HP is a partner and funder of The Circulate Initiative's Responsible Sourcing Initiative (RSI). RSI's Harmonized Responsible Sourcing Framework for Recycled Plastics aims to create an actionable global standard for responsibly sourcing recycled plastics. Through this framework and the multi-year implementation project in Vietnam, the implementation partners are actively working to ensure the responsible sourcing of recycled plastics by engaging with local governments, waste management companies, and NGOs to create scalable, sustainable solutions.

In 2024, the Vietnam implementation project undertook a baseline assessment, interviewing and assessing actors in all tiers of the value chain, including informal waste workers. Findings were shared during an in-person workshop with a recycling partner and suppliers in tiers 2, 3, and 4. The workshop resulted in an actionable, scalable improvement plan that incorporated the agreement of all key stakeholders, and included short-, medium-, and long-term solutions.

We also continued our work through the First Mile program with a recycler in Haiti that has been instrumental in converting ocean-bound plastics into high-quality recycled materials used in HP products. This partnership prioritizes the well-being of local waste collectors not only by providing safer working conditions and fair compensation but also by supporting education of the waste pickers' children. Recent civil unrest in Haiti has disrupted these efforts, causing significant challenges for the local communities and halting operations temporarily. The instability has impacted waste collection activities and has also endangered the livelihoods of the workers who rely on this industry. HP, along with our partners, needed to pause operations at times, re-evaluate the situation, and focus on rebuilding efforts within the affected communities. Priorities include re-establishing safe working conditions, restoring local infrastructure, and ensuring that the livelihoods of waste collectors are supported during this period of instability. HP continues to work closely with the recycler, local stakeholders, and NGOs to support the community's recovery and resilience, reinforcing the importance of rebuilding sustainably while addressing human rights challenges.

More than one million people in Brazil work in the informal sector as recyclable waste pickers. Through our HP &amp; Cooperatives Project (see video here), in partnership with Wirc, we collaborate with approximately 40 waste collection cooperatives in the São Paulo area to increase our positive impact and expand our sources of recycled content. In 2024, we acquired more than 830 tonnes of electronic waste from these cooperatives and converted these materials to recycled plastic for use in HP printers. This project increases the revenue of the waste-collection cooperatives and promotes decent working conditions through ongoing stakeholder engagement and assessments. We also provide smartphone-based education in areas such as health and safety, labor practices, entrepreneurship, and circular economy. In 2024, we supported more than 1,465 workers (over 54% women) through the project.
