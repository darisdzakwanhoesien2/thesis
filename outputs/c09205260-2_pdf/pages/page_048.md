# Complaints, Breaches, and Requests

HP complies with worldwide privacy and data breach notification laws and regulations, tracks the number of substantiated complaints from third parties and personal data requests made to HP by individuals, and maintains an internal incident-reporting and investigation process.

Once a potential breach of personal data is identified, a core team—including representatives from privacy, cybersecurity, legal, and communications—investigates, remediates, manages, and communicates about the breach, including any commercial or legal obligations to notify customers.

As expected, with the increase of users' awareness and empowerment in exercising their privacy rights, our overall case volume increased by 65% in 2024. However, due to the maturity of our Privacy Intake process, we were able to demonstrate our operational efficiency by handling cases without compromising our quality or response time. Also, our completed/rejected ratio remained at an acceptable level and most of the cases that fall on this category belonged to customers that failed to authenticate their identity, the first step of our process.

Finally, even if we saw an increase in the amount of breaches reported, for most of those events the amount of personal data compromised was minimum (mainly emails) and the risk low, which is why the number of substantiated complaints remained at the same level as 2023 and we had fewer reportable breaches. Still, those events helped us to identify teams that required better privacy awareness and to implement measures to correct problems.

* Breaches of customer privacy cover any nonconformance with existing legal regulations and voluntary standards regarding the protection of customer privacy related to personal data for which HP is the data controller. Substantiated complaints are written statements addressed to the organization by regulatory or similar official bodies that identify breaches of customer privacy, or complaints lodged with the organization that have been recognized as legitimate by the organization.
** Reportable data breaches are those that are required to be reported by applicable laws and regulations. The majority of total data breaches were caused by human error or technical glitches and not by a failure of our product or services security infrastructure.
*** These data relate to requests made to HP by individuals globally. The average number of days taken to respond to right to access/know requests and right to erasure/be forgotten requests in 2024 was 15.
