# Path to Net-Zero Emissions by 2040

We use GHG emissions-reduction strategies across our value chain to achieve our science-based targets and limit global warming to below 1.5°C.

## Supply Chain

Our suppliers are crucial partners in this effort. We engage closely with them to raise standards and help align their actions with our ambition by:

- Requiring suppliers to commit to using 100% renewable electricity for HP production by 2040.
- Requiring suppliers to set GHG reduction targets and report progress.
- Including sustainability metrics in our Supplier Performance Business Review Scorecards to drive performance.

## HP Operations

At HP sites around the world, we are taking action to reduce our GHG emissions through company-wide initiatives and site improvements by:

- Reducing energy consumption through optimization and efficiency projects.
- Increasing off-site renewable energy partnerships and on-site renewable electricity generation.

## Products and Solutions

By shifting toward circular product design and introducing new service models, we are reducing the environmental impact of our products by:

- Improving energy efficiency of products.
- Increasing use of recycled materials and sustainable packaging.
- Offering services to keep products in use longer—such as repair and refurbishment—and as a service model.

## Targets

We use science-based targets as a key framework to guide our emissions reduction efforts, ensuring that our strategies align with the latest climate science to achieve meaningful and measurable progress toward our sustainability goals. In 2024, our 2040 net-zero target was validated through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

This milestone builds upon HP's near-term GHG emissions reduction targets, which were validated by the SBTi in 2022, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to climate action and our ambition to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

Our targets are as follows:

- HP Inc. commits to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by Fiscal Year (FY) 2040.
- Near-term targets: HP Inc. commit to reducing absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 50% by FY2030 from a FY2019 base year.
- Long-term targets: HP Inc. commits to reducing absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 90% by FY2040 from a FY2019 base year.
