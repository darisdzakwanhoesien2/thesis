# Embedding Responsible Business Conduct

Our approach to governing human rights at HP is rooted in our commitment to fundamental dignity and respect, and it is realized through our robust policies and commitments, accountability structure, and comprehensive stakeholder engagement.

## Policies and Commitments

We are committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights as expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (together, the International Bill of Human Rights), the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the ILO Fundamental Conventions.

## Human Rights Policy

To meet new and upcoming regulatory and external stakeholder expectations, we updated and published our Human Rights Policy in 2024. In the updated policy (available in 25 languages), we reinforce our commitment to embed human rights in our operations and business relationships across our value chain. The policy introduces new commitments in key areas, including human rights and the environment, and expands on existing commitments, including our commitment to provide effective grievance mechanisms and remedy.

The policy prohibits all forms of modern slavery, including child labor, forced and bonded labor, and human trafficking.

We engaged internal and external stakeholders when updating our Human Rights Policy, including multiple internal business functions. Seven external stakeholders reviewed our updated Human Rights Policy, including four NGOs and three international organizations. Of these, four have a global presence, one is regionally based in Southeast Asia, and two are locally based in Mexico and India. The outcome of our engagement strengthened the links between our environmental and human rights strategies and expanded our existing commitments to recognize and advance the rights of human rights defenders (HRDs).

## Supplier Code of Conduct

We require that all workers in our supply chain are treated with dignity and respect. All contract suppliers (and their suppliers) must acknowledge and implement our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). The SCoC, aligned with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct, incorporates international labor and human rights principles (including the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the ILO Fundamental Conventions, the UN

Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises), outlines that suppliers involved in HP services and production need to uphold workers' rights, and includes measures for monitoring supplier compliance with the SCoC.

## Contingent Worker Code of Conduct

HP's Contingent Worker Code of Conduct applies to all non-employees ("contingent workers") performing services for HP at an HP site or an alternate work location—such as a home office, HP customer site, or other designated HP workplace—and all suppliers of contingent workers to HP. It is also applicable to HP personnel managing the contracts and assignment of contingent workers. The Code sets out our expectations for those it applies to, including prohibiting retention of contingent worker passports and personal documentation, ensuring contingent workers' ability to resign at any time, and requiring the elimination of worker-paid recruitment fees.

## Supply Chain Foreign Migrant Worker Standard

Foreign migrant workers are vulnerable to exploitative labor practices and forced labor. Our Supply Chain Foreign Migrant Worker Standard addresses these risks in our supply chain by promoting direct employment of foreign migrant workers by suppliers, requiring due diligence on recruitment agents and sub-agents when direct employment is not feasible, prohibiting retention of worker passports and personal documentation, and requiring the elimination of worker-paid recruitment fees.

## Additional Policies

Specialized policies and practices support our human rights commitments—including the HP Partner Code of Conduct—and those addressing responsible minerals sourcing, human resources, privacy and data protection, accessibility, and social and environmental responsibility.

We comply with applicable local laws and regulations. In situations where our human rights commitments go further than local laws, we are committed to following the higher standard. When laws are silent or run contrary to our human rights principles, we comply with the law while working to develop robust and creative solutions to honor human rights principles.
