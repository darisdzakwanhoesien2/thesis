2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Water-Saving Projects

In 2024, we completed several projects to reduce water use, including:

- Corvallis, Oregon, US: We completed multiple water projects at our manufacturing site in Corvallis. One notable project replaced the reverse osmosis skids in one of our energy centers, which resulted in a savings of 22,480 cubic meters of water compared with the previous year. Another project modified the piping in the same energy center to allow the cooling tower sand filter to be flushed with recycled blowdown water from the cooling tower, rather than using purified water. Due to a technical malfunction with the meter, we are only able to show 279 cubic meters of water saved this year; however we expect to the annual savings to be around 2,291 cubic meters of water going forward.

- Barcelona, Spain: To proactively address severe drought conditions, we implemented a project that replaced traditional sprinklers with a drip irrigation system, and we implemented new landscaping across the campus to feature native plants with lower water consumption requirements. Additionally, we began the installation of a stormwater collection pond that will supply water for the irrigation system. Together, these projects are expected to save 14,799 cubic meters of water per year.

- Penang, Malaysia: An unforeseen challenge emerged when a major leak developed in the main underground water pipes at our manufacturing site in Penang. Transforming a setback into an opportunity for innovation, new pipes were installed above ground to ensure immediate visibility of any future leaks. Furthermore, state-of-the-art flow meters were installed to monitor water usage in real time, allowing for proactive management of the water supply system.
