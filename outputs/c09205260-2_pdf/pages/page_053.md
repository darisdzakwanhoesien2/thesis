# Printers

HP offers the world's most secure printers,¹² and our Enterprise FutureSmart printers meet and exceed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Platform Firmware Resiliency Guidelines. These products help customers to ensure strong zero trust principles at the endpoints of their network so that all users are validated and authenticated. Our devices automatically self-heal, recover, and mitigate malware, phishing, and ransomware attacks, and they provide the following award-winning features:

- HP Sure Start maintains BIOS integrity and can automatically recover from potential attacks, saving security and print IT teams' time while strengthening endpoint device security.
- "Allowlisting" (formerly "whitelisting") ensures that both HP and HP-approved partner firmware and software are digitally signed and validated. We provide multiple levels of allowlisting for layered protection at the firmware level.
- HP Memory Shield™ includes both hardware-enforced Runtime Intrusion Detection and Control Flow Integrity.¹³ These technologies monitor the memory and code execution flow of printers for unusual and anomalous activity, detecting alterations such as those associated with zero day attacks—when hackers attempt to exploit a security vulnerability before developers can fix it. For customers, when malware and zero day attacks strike a printer, Memory Shield™ can identify the exploit and initiate automatic recovery without the need for intervention—isolating the malware and reducing the potential "blast radius" of an attack.

- HP Connection Inspector™ monitors outbound printer network connections, detects any anomalous behavior, and initiates a self-healing recovery. For example, if an abnormal quantity of domain name service packets are leaving the printer—indicating an attacker is attempting to contact its command and control server to gain access to company data—these events are captured and can be analyzed using existing security incident and event management tools, providing customers with visibility into printer-specific threat activity. As with HP Sure Start BIOS protection, HP Memory Shield™ features HP Connection Inspector™ and initiates an automatic, self-healing recovery of the device.

As an added layer of print security, Original HP office print cartridges contain tamper-resistant, proprietary firmware that helps prevent modification from third parties after production and helps reduce the risk of malicious code entering the cartridge chip.

In addition to standard penetration and vulnerability testing, HP established the print industry's first printer Bug Bounty program in 2018. HP has extended the reach of this program to incorporate additional code evaluations and supplies security. This initiative engages global white hat security researchers—individuals who use hacking skills to ethically identify security vulnerabilities—to consistently seek out any firmware, device, and network communication bugs and vulnerabilities in HP devices in advance of launch.

Risk and compliance management are vital for business continuity. HP Security Manager™ is the industry's only comprehensive policy-based printer security compliance tool, used to customize and deploy security policies and to manage, assess, and remediate device configuration settings of HP printer fleets. Critical for zero trust implementation and security compliance is HP Security Manager's ability to apply device certificates while also assessing firmware vulnerability across the entire fleet from a single easy-to-deploy server-based tool.
