# Assessments

HP conducts regular HRRAs to identify actual and potential human rights risks and impacts that HP may cause, contribute to, or be directly linked to through a business relationship. Conducted in partnership with external human rights experts, our current HRRA identified our salient human rights risks across our value chain and included a mapping and weighting of human rights risks in our value chain, a prioritized list of recommendations to advance long-term program initiatives and strategy, and a governance analysis.

We were encouraged by the HRRA's findings that reinforce our strengths, such as our robust supply chain responsibility program. We also welcomed the opportunities highlighted for improvement, such as enhancing our governance processes and more fully incorporating HRDD throughout our business.
