# Employee Volunteerism

HP taps into the talents, passions, and innovative spirit of our employees to make a difference in our communities.

In 2024, 25,671 HP employees contributed a record 360,600 hours to local volunteer efforts in 57 countries, with a value to non-profits of US$23.2 million—representing an approximately 22% increase in volunteer efforts compared with 2023.⁴ These efforts contributed to HP employees reaching the milestone of 1.6M hours volunteered since 2016. Each employee is granted four hours' paid volunteer time per month.

In 2024, for example, 150 volunteers contributed a total of 1,900 hours at Wulai School in Taiwan. Volunteers created AI curriculum to teach Taiwanese aboriginal primary students AI concepts, trends, and applications, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Suno AI. They taught AI classes, showcased HP's latest technology, provided one-on-one coaching, and conducted Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sessions to inform students on how AI can be tied to their everyday lives.
