# Economic Opportunity and Digital/AI Skills

Economic opportunities and skills are foundational to sustainable development. Technology can be a strong equalizer, bringing learning to people where they live, which is vital in a rapidly evolving world that calls for flexibility, intercultural connection, 24/7 collaboration, and lifelong learning.

For people everywhere—especially disconnected groups—equitable access to opportunity and outcome-based learning experiences are key to building skills for the Future of Work and participation in society.

# Digital Equity Accelerator

As socioeconomic divides widen around the world and society becomes increasingly reliant on digital skills and access, HP is committed to bridging these gaps. Through HP's Digital Equity Accelerator, nonprofits embedded in disconnected communities are assisted by HP in scaling their organizational impact by expanding access to technology and providing digital and AI-focused workforce development. Over the course of six months, each partner is provided with US$100,000 capacity-building grants, approximately US$100,000 in HP technology, hands-on training, mentoring and technical consultations, and opportunities for increased visibility to thrive in emerging digital and circular economies.

In 2024, HP assisted a cohort of 10 nonprofits who were selected from Brazil, Canada, and Poland, with each serving disconnected groups through economic opportunity and skills. Since 2022, the Digital Equity Accelerator has served 27 nonprofit organizations across nine countries, helping expand the reach of participating organizations by more than 9.1 million people.
