# Identifying and Assessing Adverse Impacts

We identify and assess human rights issues in our supply chain, operations, and business relationships. The Responsible Sourcing team uses a multifaceted approach, carried out throughout the year, to identify potential risks in HP's value chain.

- Human Rights Risk Assessments (HRRAs): To gain an overview of potential issues across the entire company, we conduct HRRAs to identify and analyze the risks of our potential and actual adverse human rights impacts at a global level. This process identifies our salient human rights issues, prioritizes our risks, and assists us in shaping our mitigation efforts. See Human Rights Risk Assessment.
- Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs): HP conducts HRIAs to build upon HRRA findings where more in-depth HRDD measures are appropriate, or where we want a more detailed understanding of a particular geographic location or supplier. These assessments are conducted in collaboration with independent human rights experts and include direct engagement with stakeholders, including workers in our supply chain for rights-holders' perspectives. See Human Rights Impact Assessments.
- Supplier Audits and Assessments: Our supplier audits measure conformance with all provisions of the HP Supplier Code of Conduct in the areas of labor, EHS, ethics, and management systems. See Supplier Audits and Assessments.
- Additional Programs and Activities: We identify human rights risks through our Supplier Scorecard, Corrective Action Plans, Grievance Mechanisms, and Stakeholder Engagement. Additionally, we use different tools and activities to identify human rights risks. See Additional Programs and Activities.
