and contractual sales, in an evolving distribution, reseller and customer landscape; successfully competing and maintaining the value proposition of HP's products, including supplies and services; challenges to HP's ability to accurately forecast inventories, demand and pricing, which may be due to HP's multi-tiered channel, sales of HP's products to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of HP's products or our uneven sales cycle; the hiring and retention of key employees; the results of our restructuring plans (including the fiscal 2023 plan), including estimates and assumptions related to the cost (including any possible disruption of HP's business) and the anticipated benefits of our restructuring plans; the protection of HP's intellectual property assets, including intellectual property licensed from third parties; disruptions in operations from system security risks, data protection breaches, or cyberattacks; HP's ability to maintain its credit rating, satisfy its debt obligations and complete any contemplated share repurchases, other capital return programs or other strategic transactions; changes in estimates and assumptions HP makes in connection with the preparation of its financial statements; the impact of changes to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental regulations and tax laws; integration and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions; our aspirations related to environmental or societal matters described or updated from time to time in HP's other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); HP's fiscal 2023 plan includes HP's efforts to take advantage of future growth opportunities, including but not limited to investments to drive growth, investments in our people, improving product mix, driving structural cost savings, and

other productivity measures. Structural cost savings represent gross reductions in costs driven by operational efficiency, digital transformation, and portfolio optimization. These initiatives include but are not limited to workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation, and productivity measures undertaken by HP, which HP expects to be sustainable in the longer term. These structural cost savings are net of any new recurring costs resulting from these initiatives and exclude one-time investments to generate such savings. HP's expectations on the longer-term sustainability of such structural cost savings are based on its current business operations and market dynamics, and could be significantly impacted by various factors, including but not limited to HP's evolving business models, future investment decisions, the market environment, and the technology landscape.

As in prior periods, the financial information set forth in this document, including any tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at the time of preparation of this document. While HP believes these estimates to be reasonable, these amounts could differ materially from reported amounts in HP's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending 31 July 2025. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending 31 October 2025, and HP's other filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements in this document are made as of the date of this document and HP assumes no obligation, and does not intend, to update these forward-looking statements.

Throughout this report, we use the definition of "materiality" from concepts borrowed from international standards and regulatory frameworks related to sustainability, which is different from the term as it has been defined by or construed in accordance with the securities laws or any other laws of the US or any other jurisdiction, or as used in the context of our financial statements and financial reporting or our reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Topics identified as material for the purpose of this report should not be construed as being material for SEC or other reporting purposes, financial or otherwise. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future.
