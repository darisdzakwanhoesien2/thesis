# Product Recycling Vendor Audits

Our specialized reuse and recycling vendors are required to follow specific processing techniques and comply fully with relevant regulations. HP prefers our vendors to attain third-party certification (R2, e-Stewards, or WEEELABEX), in line with EPEAT* and HP Recycling Standards. We also commission third-party audits to monitor vendor conformance with our high standards and ensure that returned items are processed appropriately. We contract with Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to audit vendors.

Using a risk-based prioritization approach, vendors are audited every three years for conformance to our policies. They are assessed on environmental, health, and safety (EHS) practices and performance,

and audits ensure there is no release of materials to facilities outside our approved vendor network. Through ERM, HP audited 32 vendor facilities in 19 countries during 2024, representing 47% of reuse vendor facilities and 40% of recycling vendor facilities. This total included repeat audits of 14 vendor facilities to evaluate their efforts to improve performance, with corrective action plans required within 30 days and issues resolved within 90 days. See Supplier Audits and Assessments for more details.

Because 83% of major nonconformances occurred at sites audited for the first time, HP's engagement brought best practices to enable immediate performance improvements. HP

has closed investigations of 93% of the major nonconformances identified in 2024. All sites with major nonconformances will be re-audited the following year to determine whether improvements are sustained. Immediate priority findings¹⁰ are the most serious type of vendor nonconformance and require immediate action. During site audits in 2024, no immediate priority findings were identified at recycling vendor sites upon re-audit. In all cases, we worked closely with the vendor to resolve and close the findings, underlining the importance of revisiting these vendor locations the following year to confirm closure is sustained.
