# 2024 HP Carbon Footprint

HP was the first global IT company to publish a full carbon footprint, which covers our entire global value chain—from our suppliers⁷ to our operations and to our millions of global customers who use our products. In 2024, our carbon footprint equaled 17,757,000 tonnes⁸ of CO₂e, 27% less than in 2019. This included a 16% reduction in absolute GHG emissions related to product manufacturing and a 46% decrease associated with product energy use.

Because 72% of our emissions occur in our supply chain, we use our scale and scope to engage closely with suppliers. This includes encouraging suppliers to address their own impacts, such as through the use of renewable electricity.

A little less than one-fourth of HP's carbon footprint comes from the use of our products. We work to continually improve product energy efficiency as well as deliver innovative service-based solutions that help customers reduce the energy use of our products.

While GHG emissions from HP operations represent only 2% of our footprint, we work to demonstrate leadership in emissions management, reduction, and disclosure. Our global operations produced 127,600 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e emissions during 2024, a 13% decrease compared with 2023.

# Methodological Updates

In 2024, we implemented key updates to our methodologies for quantifying emissions, enabling more precise and effective measurement of our carbon footprint across both operations and products. To increase the accuracy of our emissions analysis, we introduced a comprehensive suite of tools designed to estimate the carbon footprint of products and components throughout their entire lifecycle—from manufacturing to the end of product use. Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) address modeling uncertainties and variations, and they offer adaptability and scalability to meet customer and regulatory requirements. Our LCA tools underwent third-party assurance for conformance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040 and ISO 14044 standards, aligning with international best practices and further reinforcing the credibility of our methodology and calculations.

Building on HP's recent advancements, we enhanced our existing calculation engine to better represent the GHG emissions from HP printers and

developed a new calculation engine to automate carbon footprint analysis for HP's Accessories businesses. Additionally, our expanded toolset now estimates GHG emissions from industrial printing supplies, such as Indigo and PageWide Press. Together, these innovations streamline our processes while providing more precise emissions data.

As a part of our annual review, we also updated our emission factor archive to align with the latest annual and country-specific electricity emission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA) ensuring a more accurate representation of changes in national energy mixes over time.

Methodology updates impacted Scope 3 categories 1, 4, 9, 11, and 12, and these improvements to our methodology are reflected in our 2024 report. We have revised the GHG emissions data for our 2019 baseline, as well as for 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 to maintain comparability.
