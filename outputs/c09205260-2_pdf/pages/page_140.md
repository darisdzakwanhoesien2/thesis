2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Skilled and Future Ready Employees

By developing technical and digital capabilities in automation, data science, services, AI, and software skills, we aim to fuel product and services development, technology innovation, and greater customer centricity. We have developed capability academies in services, marketing, finance, digitalization of work, sales, software development, and emerging trends in customer experience design. Employees can access a range of classroom and virtual learning solutions, including new advanced engineering and software learning resources, practical projects, and opportunities to solve business challenges.

We support the continuous development of our more than 15,000 technical employees who work across a range of digital, information, and physical sciences. Thirteen HP employee communities, such as the Software Community and Data Science &amp; Knowledge Discovery, have access to a range of classroom and virtual learning programs, practical projects, and opportunities to solve business challenges. Our affinity groups and virtual communities also enable connections among technologists based on technical capabilities and common interests.

To complement the development of technology capabilities, we delivered an Ignite development experience, which focused on developing future skills that will enable employees to deepen customer focus, increase collaboration, accelerate innovation, and solve future business challenges. Skills prioritized for 2024 were AI Foundations, managing and embracing change, strategic thinking, and communications, some of which were delivered through in-person learning labs.

During 2024, an estimated 99% of employees participated in learning and development activities, with an average of 32 hours development completed per employee. The 2024 Voice Insight Action (VIA) engagement survey revealed that 84% of employees felt that HP actively supported their learning and development, with 82% believing that they were provided a real opportunity to improve their skills at HP.¹

# Continuous Learning and Career Progression

HP's Power Your Potential platform is available to all employees. It enables skill development and career planning through a wide range of personalized learning opportunities, including virtual, social, self-directed, mentoring, coaching, and face-to-face experiences. Alongside this platform, we offer a variety of collaborative learning experiences, connection to a network of subject matter experts, and a social learning platform that enables employees to integrate development into their daily routines. There are also opportunities for employees to attend conferences and seminars and to acquire professional memberships, accreditations, and certifications.

Across the globe, managers have sponsored career development webinars, one-to-one career coaching opportunities, and career fairs. In addition, HP's Degree Assistance Program provides over 570 employees worldwide with the opportunity to participate in higher academic education with a variety of businesses and technical colleges and universities. According to the 2024 VIA employee survey, 79% of employees believe their career goals can be met at HP. Our commitment to providing internal career mobility continued to be a priority during 2024, with 38% of job vacancies filled by internal candidates.²

# Modernizing Our Approach to Talent Development

In 2024, HP launched a new approach to modernize how we find and develop internal talent, grounded in skills and powered by technology. Our new AI-powered Career Hub provides employees with personalized skills profiles and career recommendations, tailored learning paths, and recommendations that support their professional goals, career aspirations, and future skills development. This new approach aligns talent growth with long-term business objectives and empowers both managers and employees to improve transparency and drive performance and growth.

Career Hub also enables our Talent Acquisition team and business leaders to accelerate the process for identifying future skills needs. This provides input into a skills-based recruitment process, and the platform improves the quality and speed of identifying suitable internal and external candidates for emerging job roles.

Managers also play a crucial role in empowering employees to develop their careers. Our Employee Guidance Tool serves as input for people managers to create personalized development plans for each of their team members. These plans focus on skill advancement and new experiential opportunities to bolster performance and career mobility with a data driven, skills-first approach. In 2024, we focused on equipping managers with capabilities and skills to coach their teams, with plans to further extend this key objective into 2025.³

# Performance Management and Feedback Culture

HP has a robust, feedback-based culture and approach to performance management. During 2024, 90.3% of eligible employees received multi-dimensional and objective-based performance evaluations. We introduced Quarterly Conversations, which are performance conversations between managers and employees that provide timely feedback, guide career development, and improve performance consistency throughout the year. These structured discussions help managers deliver more robust coaching and support employees' career aspirations.

By fostering a culture of continuous feedback, agility, and scalability, HP adapts to market demands while enhancing employee potential. This holistic approach aligns workforce development with business performance, enhancing employee growth while supporting HP's long-term goals. Our 2024 VIA survey found that 89% of employees believe they receive feedback throughout the year that enables them to improve their performance.
