# Nature-Based Solutions

Forests are a source of food, medicine, fuel, and jobs for more than a billion people,³⁹ and support much of the planet's biodiversity. As climate change impacts on biodiversity continue to increase, the role that business plays in forest protection, management, and restoration must also grow.

For years, HP has partnered with leading preservation and conservation organizations including WWF, Conservation International, and The Arbor Day Foundation on forest-related initiatives. Key projects in 2024 include:

## WWF

Partners since 2009, HP is part of WWF's Forests Forward program to make a meaningful and enduring positive impact on forests and the communities that depend on them. As a founding member of the program,⁴⁰ HP supports WWF's forest work in four countries, focused on specific landscape investments and responsible sourcing.⁴¹

Through this partnership, HP has committed to the restoration, protection, and improved management of 228,966 hectares of forest, an area nearly three times the size of New York City, while also supporting WWF's efforts to develop science-based solutions for forests.

## Forest Landscape Investments

HP supports WWF China's focus to improve forest management by engaging with forest managers in four provinces across China. WWF is helping them achieve certification through the FSC's certification program, recognized globally as the gold standard for forest certification. Additional goals of the project are to restore habitat for the endangered Asian Elephant and increase awareness about sustainable forest products. Since 2020, HP and WWF have been working towards improving the forest management of 89,000 hectares by 2025. In 2024, the project achieved FSC certification on 61,205 hectares of forests for a total of 123,017 hectares of improved forest management in China. This equates to 138% progress toward our goal.

In Brazil, HP supports multiple restoration, protection, and conservation initiatives, including helping recover natural forests across 1,050 hectares of the Atlantic Forest and protect 52,000 hectares across three national parks in the country's southern Bahia state, which in 2011 was identified by Conservation International as one of the 10 most endangered forests in the world.⁴² HP's work in these forests is helping build the capacity of park managers and grow local, sustainable business enterprises. In addition to supporting the protection of these three national parks, HP's partnership with WWF in 2024 led to the transition of 62 hectares of degraded forest to forest-in-recovery through on-the-ground restoration action. This brings the total area of forest our collaboration is helping to restore to 618 hectares in Brazil.

HP also supports WWF's work to restore connectivity and jaguar (Panthera onca) habitat among remnant forest patches across the Madre de Dios region of Peru, part of the Amazon rainforest. The goal is to transition 200 hectares of jaguar habitat from disconnected and degraded forest to reconnected areas under restoration by 2025, while improving the forest management of 60,000 hectares and supporting the diversity and sustainability of local livelihoods and job opportunities. The jaguar is identified as a Near Threatened species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, and the Madre de Dios region of Peru is known for having the highest concentration of bird diversity in the world.⁴³ In 2024, 85% of the forest restoration goal was achieved, representing 170 hectares. Additionally, 88% of the improved forest management goal was met through activities covering 53,000 hectares of forest, of which 25,000 hectares achieved FSC certification.

## 565,000

acres of forest helped to conserve in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

In Australia, HP supports the creation of alliances to halt and reverse native forest loss, while maintaining robust forest and agricultural industries across the diverse temperate and tropical ecosystems of Eastern Australia. These forests contain key habitat for many species, including endangered koalas and greater gliders whose populations have steeply declined in the past few decades.⁴⁴⁻⁵⁰ In Eastern Australia, HP is assisting WWF's projects in two states. In New South Wales (NSW), we are supporting efforts to transition forest practices from unsustainable native logging to sustainable plantation forestry, and in Queensland we are helping develop deforestation-free beef standards.
