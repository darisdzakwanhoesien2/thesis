# Renewable Energy

In 2024, we sourced and generated a total of 297,846 MWh of renewable electricity, with 74% from wind, 4% from solar, and 22% from mixed wind and solar. This resulted in renewables accounting for 62% of our global electricity consumption—up from 59% in 2023—while maintaining our commitment to 100% renewable electricity in the US.

# #18

on the Green Power Partnership Top 30 Tech &amp; Telecom list (as of October 2024).

# Renewable Electricity Use

## 2025 GOAL

Use 100% renewable electricity in our operations by 2025.

## 62%

achieved. HP's global operations procured and generated 298,000 MWh of renewable electricity and attributes in 2024.

By implementing energy-saving technologies and processes, we aim to minimize overall demand. Sources of renewable electricity in 2024 included Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), Guarantees of Origin (GOs), and International RECs (I-RECs) (91%), of which 66% are US-RECs and 34% are I-RECs; green electricity contracts (6%), and renewable energy generated on site and on-site Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) (3%). Through these purchases, we continue to use 100% renewable electricity in the US™-all of which ensure the electricity we use comes from clean, sustainable sources. Together, these actions are central to our goal of reducing operational emissions and supporting a transition to a low-carbon future.

In regions where direct procurement of renewable energy is either not permitted or financially challenging (e.g., Canada, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, and the US), HP is exploring virtual PPAs to advance our renewable energy objectives and help drive the decarbonization of power grids worldwide.

Building on previous renewable energy initiatives—such as the solar-covered roof at our Palo Alto headquarters in California, US (a feed-in tariff project)—HP continued to pursue renewable energy projects in 2024, including the installation of an 854 kW solar electricity system at our site in Jalisco, Mexico. Once operational, it is expected to generate up to 92% of the site's annual energy consumption.
