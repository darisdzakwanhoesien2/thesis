# Remediation and Access to Remedy

In accordance with the UNGPs, when businesses identify that they have caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts, they should provide for or cooperate in their remediation. Remedies include access to grievance mechanisms that are legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning to prevent recurrence of the underlying harm.

HP is committed to remediation of adverse human rights impacts, including providing effective avenues for addressing and resolving those impacts in our supply chain. Remedies also include engaging in corrective action for identified risks, which involves relevant stakeholder consultation.

Our remediation framework encompasses structured grievance mechanisms and incident reporting systems, facilitating open channels for impacted individuals and communities to raise concerns. Robust grievance mechanisms are essential for identifying issues, offering a pathway to justice, and fostering trust across our operations and partnerships. This approach ensures transparency and accountability while

driving improvements in human rights practices. Each grievance is treated with due diligence, and where warranted, our corrective action plans are designed not only to resolve specific issues but also to prevent their recurrence.

The development of corrective action and improvement plans is integral to our remediation approach. These plans are created with input from relevant stakeholders, ensuring that solutions are both effective and respectful of local contexts. By continuously monitoring the effectiveness of these mechanisms, we work to reinforce our commitment to human rights, building resilience within our supply chains and enhancing our capacity to respond to emerging risks.
