* Totals include all hardware and supplies returned to HP for processing, with ultimate dispositions including recycling, energy recovery, and, where no suitable alternatives exist, responsible disposal. Although for HP print cartridges we report the composition of recovered materials, we cannot provide these data for hardware because we do not have operational control over all recycling processes and so do not have access to this information. Through 2015, Hewlett-Packard Company reported 1,497,500 tonnes of cumulative computer hardware and supplies recycling combined.
** The number of countries or territories where HP offers legislation-driven and/or voluntary hardware take-back and recycling programs, and/or voluntary ink and/or toner take-back and recycling programs. Program availability varies. For details, see hp.com/ recycle.
*** Beginning in 2021, these data are based on the actual weight of every product. Prior to 2021, data were estimated based on the average weight of each product category.
*** Reused material is defined as recovered products or components of products that are used for the same purpose for which they were conceived. A reused product (part should replace a new product/part shipment, and the product/part needs to have been used by a customer and refurbished before being sent to a different user. Prior to 2021, these data also included some units remarketed to customers that had not been refurbished or used. Beginning in 2021, these data are based on the actual weight of every product. Prior to 2021, data w/were estimated based on the average weight of each product category.
† The reuse rate is based on the weight of hardware products returned for reuse compared with the weight of our product sales during the year.
†† The recycling rate is based on the weight of hardware products returned for recycling compared with the weight of our product sales from seven years ago (the estimated average lifespan of our products). It is impractical for HP to report the recycling rate by product category, as materials are not typically sorted at collection points. This rate also does not include packaging recycling, due to limited data available from recyclers.
††† Includes cartridges returned by customers only.
