Transform HP's Value Chain | Forests | Nature Based Solutions

In 2024, we supported the restoration of 128 hectares of koala habitat, which represents 21% progress towards our on-track goal of restoring 600 hectares by the end of 2025. These areas of Australia were devastated by widespread fires in 2019 and 2020 and were impacted by severe flooding shortly thereafter. WWF's HP-funded work is helping to improve the resiliency of this area, which has become more important with the effects of climate change.

## Conservation International

HP and Conservation International (CI) have worked together since 2013. In 2024, we continued our work with CI to support their collaboration with Indigenous peoples to conserve globally important forests and support community development in Indonesia and Brazil. In South Sorong, Indonesia, we partnered to help improve the management of forests with high biodiversity and natural resources that local communities depend on. Due to their high carbon sequestration value, the loss of these forests would also seriously challenge the achievement of global net zero goals and have an irreversible impact on climate change. In 2024, HP also supported the establishment and capacity-building of local community enterprises to enable more sustainable livelihoods.

In the Xingu Region of the Brazilian Amazon, HP supported CI's 2024 efforts to strengthen the Xingu+ Network, a regional alliance of Indigenous peoples dedicated to protecting the territories of the Xingu corridor and upholding the rights of its people. With relatively little known about the biodiversity found here, HP supported knowledge exchange between forest scientists and the Panará people to document and monitor the local flora and fauna. As stewards of their ancestral lands, the Panará are conducting protection patrols and building a network of conservation throughout the region to combat deforestation and land degradation.

## The Arbor Day Foundation

In addition, HP has an established partnership with The Arbor Day Foundation, a global nonprofit with a mission to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees, with a dedicated focus on forests and communities most in need of trees. In 2024, HP collaborated with The Arbor Day Foundation on 10 global projects to plant 31,877 trees. Two of these projects were in the US, including an effort to restore coastal forest habitat throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed and along the Rappahannock River in Virginia, and a post-fire recovery project in southern Oregon within the Klamath Falls Basin. Other projects occurred in Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Columbia, Madagascar, Germany, Brazil, and Scotland. Since 2020, HP has helped plant over six million trees through 72 projects in partnership with The Arbor Day Foundation.
