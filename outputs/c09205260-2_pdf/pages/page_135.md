# Care Coordination and Innovation

The technologies we deploy provide healthcare organizations with the ability to extend collaborative care and accelerate medical progress. Telehealth is essential to reaching underserved populations and address biases in care provision. HP-Poly's Telehealth products and services support healthcare providers by addressing challenges related to access, cost, and quality. These high-quality, noise-free audio and video devices offer providers the reliability and precision they require for vital healthcare services, while ensuring sessions are secured through advanced encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms.

HP's advanced inkjet and microfluidics technology have allowed us to expand into new applications. Pharmaceutical companies, drug manufacturers, hospitals, medical laboratories, and pharmacies require a wide variety of high-quality variable data coding and marking print solutions and color labels. HP inkjet systems enable human- and machine-readable codes and marks to be printed directly on packages, enhancing product identification and security. Further, by using HP Thermal Inkjet technology, drug discovery researchers around the world can more precisely and efficiently print ultra small volumes of drug compounds and reagents to accelerate the search for new therapies for human diseases.

Based on our microfluidics capabilities, HP's Single Cell Dispenser is designed to provide researchers with an affordable and robust solution to isolate and analyze how individual cells respond to drugs and other factors. At least 40 scientific publications and presentations are based on data derived from the Single Cell Dispenser to accelerate precision medicine research in search of better patient outcomes, including helping researchers identify ways to maximize the number of tumor cells that respond to cancer therapies. 2024 was the dispenser's first full year of global sales through an HP Life Science channel partner as the Tecan Uno Single Cell Dispenser. The device uses inkjet printer technology to dispense liquid samples containing cells in the 10- to 25-micron range—less than half the width of a human hair.

Early adopters range across Pharma and Academic research institutions. For example, Oregon State University researchers use this HP technology to learn more about age-related diseases. By isolating living cells from specimens, scientists are studying which proteins affect aging and dementia. We implemented the use of ocean-bound plastic for the cartridges that dispense the cells; the material is recycled plastic and made from reclaimed ocean-bound plastic.

# Patient Privacy and Security

Safeguarding patient privacy and security is paramount in the healthcare industry. Due to HP's global presence, many of our commercial customers are subject to specialized privacy and security regulations related to healthcare data, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the US and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. As both a processor and a controller of healthcare data, our compliance responsibilities are of utmost importance.

HP's Privacy by Design approach provides us with a solid compliance foundation. Our products and services have implemented controls designed to protect health data and to prevent security incidents. Experts from Legal, Data Privacy, the HIPAA Compliance Office, and Global Cybersecurity frequently monitor regulatory changes and interpretations that may impact how we service our customers and employees.

An ongoing collaborative effort exists between these HP expert teams and our Sales, Service, and Research and Development (R&amp;D) teams to identify and mitigate compliance risks and provide appropriate training for all employees who may encounter personal health information.
