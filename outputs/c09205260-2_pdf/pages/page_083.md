To calculate Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, HP has followed the principles outlined in the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Additional details on calculations and methodology can be found in the HP Carbon accounting manual. Scope 1 GHG emissions include CO2, CH4, NZO, HFCs, and PFCs. No biogenic emissions are present in this category. Scope 2 GHG emissions include CO2, CH4, and NZO. No biogenic emissions are present in this category. For Scope 3 GHG emissions:

- "Materials extraction through manufacturing" (category 1), "Transportation" (categories 4 and 9), "Product use" (category 11), and "Product end of service" (category 12) include CO2, CH4, NZO, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3, and represented more than 98% of our Scope 3 emissions in 2024. Biogenic emissions are present and captured in the paper emissions factor of HP paper manufactured (category 1).

- "Capital goods" (category 2) includes CO2, CH4, NZO, and HFCs, and represented 0.3% of our Scope 3 emissions in 2024.

- "Upstream energy production" (category 3) and "Business travel" (category 6) include CO2, CH4, and NZO, and represented 0.5% of our Scope 3 emissions in 2024.

- "Employee commuting" (category 7) and "Buildings leased to others" (category 13) include CO2, and represented 0.7% of our Scope 3 emissions in 2024.

- "Waste generated in operations" (category 5) and "Upstream leased assets" (category 8) emissions are less than 0.25% of Scope 3 emissions and reported as "de minimis."

- "Processing of sold products" (category 10), "Franchises" (category 14), and "Investments" (category 15) are not relevant to HP. In some cases, segments might not add up to total due to rounding.

Total includes HP's reported values for Scope 1 and 2 market-based method emissions in table.

Emissions intensity values were calculated using HP's annual revenue as characterized in financial reporting and Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.

CO2e emissions associated with CH4 and NZO account for less than 1% of total CO2e emissions in this category.

HP collects all refrigerant consumption data from local facility maintenance teams company-wide, directly accounting for facilities/ refrigerant leakage eliminating the need for extrapolation. GHG emissions are calculated using the appropriate emissions factor for each type of refrigerant.

Data in this section use the market-based method. Due to the availability and feasibility of acquiring the data, the company only obtained utility-specific emission factors for its sites in Glasgow, UK, Geneva, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and sites in the US (Palo Alto, San Diego, and San Bernardino, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Sandston, Virginia; and Socorro and Houston, Texas).

See Methodological Updates.

Scope 2 GHG emissions used to calculate this category were determined using the location-based method.

This product transportation data is based on LCA-based estimates. It uses a combination of HP-specific and industry data, and includes additional upstream and downstream transportation related to our products. These data may differ from data reported by product transportation suppliers that HP contracts to deliver our products, as presented in Product Transportation and Supply chain Environmental Impact.

HP's global travel agency provides values that account for the type of aircraft, passenger load, cabin class, and miles traveled for each ticketed trip. The data also includes rail travel carriers and distance traveled. Our rental emissions are currently included in nonproduction supplier emissions (included in Category 1).

Includes serviced offices rented from others where HP acts as tenant. They are excluded from Scope 1 and 2 because HP does not have operational control. Leased furniture and equipment are included in "Capital goods" (category 2).

Since 3 emissions from inkjet and laserjet printers that HP manufactures for sale and service by other original equipment manufacturers are excluded from our carbon footprint, Scope 1 and 2 emissions from the manufacturing of these printers at HP operated facilities are captured in the Scope 1 and 2 data reported in this year's report.
