2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Performance

In 2024, we launched the conflict minerals survey to our in-scope suppliers, which includes final assembly and commodity suppliers of products and components containing 3TG. We received responses from 100% of our in-scope suppliers.

These responses expressed that the smelters and refiners in our supply chain were either conformant or in the process of becoming conformant with an independent assessment program, and/or, we reasonably believe, that they exclusively source 3TG minerals from recycled or scrap sources by the time we closed the survey in January 2025.

# US Securities and Exchange Commission Conflict Minerals Report

Each year, we file our Form SD and Conflict Minerals Report with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), disclosing our due diligence efforts and results. See our SEC Conflict Minerals Report for more information and our performance details.

# Additional Efforts

Having learned from our experience combating conflict minerals in the DRC and surrounding countries, we are expanding our efforts. This commitment aligns with growing awareness of mineral-sourcing issues beyond the DRC and surrounding countries covered by the US Dodd-Frank Act. The EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, which covers EU imports of 3TG minerals from all regions of the world, requires all large EU 3TG metal importers and smelters to become "responsible importers" consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. Although HPs operations are not within the scope of the EU Conflict Minerals regulation, we have voluntarily aligned our policy and approach to support our customers' requirements consistent with the regulation.

Because cobalt has been linked to human rights risks, we set clear requirements for our suppliers to enact policies that address cobalt, and our minerals due diligence measurements also includes cobalt. We ask suppliers to provide us with details of the cobalt refiners they use, and we work with them to encourage those refiners to complete an RMI assessment. Additionally, we encourage suppliers to engage in collaborative industry action through the RMI. For more details on our responsible cobalt sourcing practices and due diligence results, please refer to our Cobalt Report.

In addition to these commitments, we also collaborated with an external consultant to address the upcoming mineral requirements on new regulations, such as the EU Battery &amp; Waste Regulation. As a result, we are expanding our responsible minerals program to cover nickel, lithium, and natural graphite. See our responsible minerals sourcing expectations for suppliers in HP's GSE.
