Findings with lowest rates of conformance of sites audited, 2022 and 2024*

|  Finding | Rate of conformance 2022*** | Rate of conformance 2024*** | HP's approach  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Labor Management System - Control process** | - % | 35% | Suppliers are expected to have adequate and effective labor policies and control processes. Corrective actions to this finding regularly include assessing and updating existing labor policies, control processes, and procedures, ensuring reviews for continuous improvement.  |
|  Working hours | 34% | 37% | Excessive working hours remain one of the most pressing labor challenges in the industry across the supply chain. Among suppliers in our Labor KPI Program (100 at the end of 2024, representing approximately 81,400 workers), 98% met our requirements related to working hours in 2024, compared with 98% in 2023 and 96% in 2022. During 2024, our requirements related to workers' days of rest were met by 97% of suppliers in the program, compared with 99% in 2023 and 97% in 2022.*** The year-over-year changes in conformance rates of these two categories indicate that our Labor KPI Program members (expanded by 23% in the number of suppliers) are continually working towards an effective management of working hours and days of rest expectations.  |
|  Wages and benefits | 59% | 53% | In countries without a set minimum wage, the industry prevailing wage applies. The most common issue in the industry in wages and benefits is suppliers not paying appropriate social insurance to their workers. Examples of corrective actions related to wages and benefits include maintaining documentation of pay stubs, employer contributions to worker insurance schemes, and worker communication.  |
|  Health & Safety Management System - Control process** | - % | 62% | Suppliers are expected to implement adequate and effective health and safety policies and control processes. Suppliers should also continuously monitor and improve health and safety practices, ensuring they comply with relevant laws and regulations. Examples of corrective actions include revising and updating existing health and safety policies, organizing EHS trainings, and establishing regular inspections of health and safety control processes.  |
|  Occupational safety | 56% | 64% | Nonconformances relate regularly to current safety permits and first aid-response reporting. Suppliers must have tracking mechanisms and keep documentation of remediation and compensation provided to workers involved in an incident. A supplier with a nonconformance must also prove that training for workers and management has been conducted or will be conducted within 180 days.  |
|  Emergency preparedness | 48% | 68% | Common nonconformances in this category include: blocked exit doors, missing or poorly lit exit signs, lack of fire exit instructions, and missing or defective emergency equipment. We supplement our audits with specific health and safety assessments to ensure timely closure of all potential findings in this category.  |

* Data are from initial audits and full re-audits of production suppliers conducted in 2022 and 2024. Due to our two-year audit cycle and changes to HP's supplier base, data typically do not represent the same supplier sites as the previous cycle. Data refer to the RBA Code of Conduct 7.01, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13 and 8.0.
** After protocol 7.01, the industry pivoted to a new audit methodology. As a result, some 2022 categories cannot be directly compared with 2024.
*** Percentage of sites with no immediate priority findings, non-immediate priority nonconformances, or major nonconformances identified.
*** The HP Labor KPI Program measures the performance of HP production lines at participating supplier facilities and not the overall performance of those facilities. In contrast, initial audits and full re-audits assess the overall performance of supplier facilities where other brands in addition to HP may also manufacture products.
