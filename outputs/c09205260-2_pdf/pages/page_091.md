# Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD)

Everyone across HP's value chain should be treated with dignity and respect. Our due diligence process$^{47}$ is grounded in the UN Guiding Principles (UNGPs) for Business and Human Rights and in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

## Our Approach to Human Rights Due Diligence

Our robust process, guided by the six steps outlined in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, is implemented with continual improvement in mind, engaging with internal and external stakeholders every step of the way.

- **Embedding Responsible Business Conduct**
We maintain a strong governance system to embed responsible business conduct throughout the entire organization. We integrate findings into our policies and management systems. We strive to continually improve and expand our systems to manage identified salient human rights risks.

- **Identifying and Assessing Adverse Impacts**
We engage with rights-holders and stakeholders in our operations, supply chains, and business relationships to identify, assess, and prioritize issues across our value chain based on severity and likelihood.

- **Remediation**
We commit to providing access to—and not obstructing—effective remedy for adverse impacts when appropriate.

- **Ceasing, Preventing, or Mitigating Adverse Impacts**
Informed by our ongoing risk and impact assessments, we take steps to cease, mitigate, or prevent adverse impacts on people and communities.

- **Tracking Implementation and Results**
As we track the implementation and results of our program, we ensure that performance against baselines is properly recorded. We aim for continuous improvement, utilizing our supplier monitoring and evaluation program to identify optimization opportunities.

- **Communicating Commitments**
We disclose our due diligence process and salient human rights risks, as well as how we address adverse impacts.
