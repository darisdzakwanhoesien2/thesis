# Energy Efficiency

Energy consumption is the primary driver of our operational GHG emissions, and we continue to identify and invest in opportunities to improve energy efficiency and accelerate our transition to renewable energy sources.

In 2024, our operations consumed 682,398 MWh of energy, marking a 6% reduction from 2023. This decrease was driven by energy conservation projects and reduced natural gas usage across all three regions where HP operates (AMS, EMEA, and AFU). To better align with reporting and GHG emissions accounting standards, we updated our methodology at our Palo Alto, California, US, site, excluding tenant emissions from Scope 2 and reallocating them to Scope 3. This adjustment prevented double counting and reduced our reported direct operational energy consumption. Energy intensity decreased by 6% in 2024 compared with 2023, reflecting our lower energy usage.

In 2024, we implemented several impactful energy reduction initiatives, including 28 energy conservation projects as a part of our operations energy efficiency program, and an additional five projects as a part of a Strategic Energy Management program at our Corvallis, Oregon, US, site. These projects reduced HP's annual energy consumption by an estimated 6,701 MWh in FY24. Our 2024 initiatives include:

- Corvallis, Oregon, US: The site team partnered with the Energy Trust of Oregon to perform a yearlong Strategic Energy Management (SEM) Program to identify energy savings opportunities and implement corrective actions, resulting in an estimated 525 MWh annual energy savings.

- Kiryat-Gat, Israel: We performed a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) retrocommissioning project, which optimized the performance of the HVAC equipment while saving an estimated 1,356 MWh of annual electricity consumption. The project is expected to break even in 1.9 years.

- Bangalore, India: We upgraded the efficiency of the air conditioning equipment serving our data center, saving an estimated 1,064 MWh annually, which is equivalent to 12% of the site's entire consumption.

To ensure that our initiatives are adequately funded, HP runs a global energy management program that includes an annual budget to implement energy saving projects. We also deployed site-specific energy management programs at a number of major sites, including the Strategic Energy Management program at our Corvallis, Oregon, US, site, and ISO 50001 (energy management) certifications at two sites in Singapore and one site in China.

Within our operations, HP also raises awareness of energy efficiency and energy reduction strategies by sending periodic communications to managers to share with their employees.
