# Health and Safety

HP is committed to ensuring the health and safety of our employees and contractors, recognizing the importance of providing a safe working environment to support productivity and success. Through robust training programs, clear communication, and leadership engagement, we ensure that our workforce understands and embraces their role in maintaining a safe workplace.

HP's Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) management system aligns with the American National Standards Institute 210 and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standards to drive environmental, health, and safety improvements. With a core operating principle of plan-do-check-act, we have established procedures for reviewing, modifying, and incorporating workplace EHS hazards processes into our EHS management system.

To continually develop our global EHS management system, we engage with and seek input from safety professionals, management teams, and partners across HP. We employ and train professionals to manage, monitor, and maintain our systems, with a responsibility to ensure they operate with minimal environmental impact. When an HP work-related health and safety incident occurs, supervisors are required to identify the root cause, develop and implement corrective action plans, and track solutions to completion. Employees receive guidance to identify and report hazards, and channels exist to report hazards outside their immediate control, for action by facility teams.

We regularly measure our environmental performance and challenge ourselves when

making annual improvement plans. All locations must proactively implement company-wide health and safety standards. Any new equipment and chemicals, along with any changes to the work environment, are reviewed for safety and environmental issues, and any issues are addressed accordingly.

All HP facilities have assigned technical EHS personnel, and our global EHS team provides guidance and oversight. We ensure that our employees feel able to remove themselves from situations they believe are unsafe. Joint management-worker health and safety committees exist in some locations, and we regularly discuss relevant policies, processes, and regulatory compliance with employees.

When feasible, we pursue environmental management certifications at HP-owned and leased facilities worldwide. As of the end of 2024, 21 facilities, including all HP manufacturing sites, were certified to ISO 14001:2015 (the most recent version), with 17 as part of our global ISO 14001 certificate. Twelve facilities, including 50% of HP manufacturing sites, were certified to ISO 45001:2018 for occupational health and safety.

In 2024, about 9,990 employees and agency contractors took part in 26 instructor-led courses and completed over 24,400 sessions of web-based EHS training courses. Our training includes information about general workplace issues, as well as targeted information for specific roles.

Our EHS leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting system to monitor worldwide and regional trends as part of quarterly reviews. Supervisors of employees who suffer work-related injuries are required to conduct thorough injury and illness investigations, working closely with EHS points of contact to assess serious or complex cases.

Our long-term objective is to achieve a zero-incident workplace, where all employees and contractors do not experience any injury or illness resulting from their work. To achieve this commitment, we focus on continuous improvement, actively monitor safety performance metrics, and implement corrective actions where needed.

In 2024, we achieved a global lost workday case rate of 0.06 and a total recordable incidence rate of 0.12, compared with 2023 average rates (the most recent data available) of 0.06 and 0.11, respectively, in the North American Industry Classification System

(NAICS) US Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing Industry (NAICS Code 33411).

While our manufacturing facilities continue to present greater health and safety risks, we remain focused on reducing and effectively managing risks to maintain low injury rates. We implement programs that address common hazards at our sites, such as ergonomic issues, slips, and falls. Furthermore, we use the hierarchy of controls framework for managing existing hazards. We also prioritize the safety of HP employees working beyond our facilities—such as field service technicians visiting customer sites—by providing training and related testing on issues such as safe vehicle operation and proper lifting techniques.

Systems are in place for employees and contractors to report EHS incidents and concerns promptly. Additionally, we prioritize open communication and actively consult with workers and their representatives on occupational health and safety matters.
