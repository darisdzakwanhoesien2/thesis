2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Governance and Accountability

HP's commitments to governance, accountability, and respecting human rights are embedded across all levels of the company, from our Board of Directors to our employees.

HP's chief sustainability officer and director of climate and responsible sourcing, who both sit within HP's enterprise operations team, manage and drive the accountability of our company-wide human rights policies, due diligence processes, and commitments in our operations and supply chain. Our Human Rights Policy has been approved by our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee (NGSRC).

# Human Rights Council

HP's internal, cross-functional Human Rights Council guides day-to-day human rights priorities across our organization and meets twice each year to review progress. The Council consists of executives across the business, representing functions such as human resources; inclusion and belonging; trust and privacy; global indirect procurement; supply chain operations; Sustainable Impact; government affairs and public policy; legal; corporate affairs; investor relations; and environment, health, and safety (EHS).

The Council reviews our ongoing human rights assessments to inform plans for the continual improvement of our human rights strategy, and it also promotes the alignment, integration, and implementation of our Human Rights Policy and related programs and initiatives across HP. During 2024, the Council reviewed and approved HP's updated Human Rights Policy, discussed macro-environment trends related to human rights, examined the risks and opportunities of AI in human rights, and evaluated compliance readiness action plans in response to upcoming regulations, among other topics.

# Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee

The NGSRC of the HP Board of Directors oversees our significant strategies, policies, positions, and goals relating to human rights, including reviewing the results of our ongoing human rights assessments and approving our annual company-wide Modern Slavery Transparency Statement. The NGSRC receives regular updates on human rights-related topics, many of which are informed by internal and external human rights experts as well as the perspectives and experiences of affected stakeholders.

In 2024, the NGSRC was updated on HP's human rights-related sustainability strategy, conflict minerals disclosure, regulatory requirements, and HP actions in partnership with leading initiatives to mitigate and prevent identified risks as part of our approach to HRDD. The NGSRC also reviewed and approved HP's updated Human Rights Policy.

# Global Responsible Sourcing Team

HP's director of climate and responsible sourcing, who reports to the chief sustainability officer, oversees our Global Responsible Sourcing team. This team is responsible for implementing our commitment to respect human rights in our operations across the HP value chain and maintains responsibility across three primary functions: ongoing due diligence, supplier monitoring, and reporting. When conducting our HRDD, the team develops programs, processes, and tools to ensure that suppliers adhere to HP's Supplier Code of Conduct and embed respect for human rights across the business. Team members also provide support, guidance, and resources to internal partners—such as procurement, human resources, and other internal stakeholders—and lead our external stakeholder engagement with partnering organizations and individuals.

In 2024, the team's work focused on anticipating and managing increasing regulatory expectations for human rights. This work included addressing topics such as ensuring adequate wages, health, and safety standards; preventing and addressing risks of modern slavery; and delivering training and skill development to safeguard working conditions for individuals across the value chain.
