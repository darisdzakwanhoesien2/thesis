* Data are from initial audits and full re-audits of production suppliers conducted in 2022 and 2024. Due to our two-year audit cycle and changes to HP's supplier base, data typically do not represent the same supplier sites as the previous cycle.
** Percentage of sites with no immediate priority findings, non-immediate priority nonconformances, or major nonconformances identified. Data refer to the RBA Code of Conduct 7.01, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13 and 8.0.
*** After protocol 7.01, the industry pivoted to a new audit methodology. As a result, some 2022 categories cannot be directly compared with 2024.
