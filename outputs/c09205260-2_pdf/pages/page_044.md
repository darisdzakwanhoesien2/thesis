Since 2022, HP has led the industry with the highest number of EPEAT® Gold and Silver certificates for personal systems globally.⁹⁸ In early 2025, HP further expanded the number of ENERGY STAR® certified personal systems and printing products to more than 800. To help consumers better understand these certifications, we provide detailed information about product safety and environmental attributes online and play an active role in shaping new standards.

ENERGY STAR certified personal systems and printing products—more than any other manufacturer.⁹⁹

## Achieving Rigorous Environmental and Health Certification for HP Inks

In 2011, HP became the first printing manufacturer to have UL ECOLOGO® Certified ink for its large format printers. During 2022, we also became the first in our industry to offer UL ECOLOGO® Certification for home and office printing products. Original HP ink cartridges that are UL ECOLOGO® Certified meet stringent standards in health and environment, manufacturing and operations, materials, energy, and more.¹⁰⁰ We achieved this certification for hundreds of additional products in 2024. By the end of the year, more than 700 HP home and office ink cartridges were UL ECOLOGO® Certified and designated as Amazon Climate Pledge Friendly.⁹⁰

Additionally, our latest water-based HP Latex Ink is the only technology to achieve UL ECOLOGO®¹⁰⁰ across multiple platforms. HP water-based Latex ink was the first to achieve GREENGUARD Gold¹⁰⁰ certification in 2012 in the signage market and the newest generation is still certified to this date.

In 2024, the HP DesignJet Smart Tank T858 Printer, the HP Designjet 2600 series, HP DesignJet Z9 Printer Series, and the HP Latex 630 series were EPEAT Climate+ registered.¹⁰⁰
