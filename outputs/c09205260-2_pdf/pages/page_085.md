Δ These data are based on suppliers reporting to CDP and other platforms. As a result, these data are not available for the most recent reporting year at the time of publication.
* In some cases, data from prior years are updated to reflect improved data (for example, revised supplier information).
** Variation in these data reflects both changes in actual performance and inconsistency in reporting practices.
*** Emissions are calculated based on suppliers' reported emissions and their dollar volume of HP business compared with their total revenue. The majority of these companies report on a calendar-year basis.
† Suppliers may not report all Scope 3 categories. The number of categories reported by suppliers and the completeness of reporting varies. We encourage suppliers to measure and report Scope 3 categories that are significant to their supply chains, such as "Materials extraction through manufacturing" (category 1), "Transportation" (categories 4 and 9), and others. Data not reported prior to 2022.
†† Total energy includes purchased energy (electricity, etc.) and generated energy (fuel use, etc.). Energy use data are calculated based on suppliers' reported energy use and their dollar volume of HP business compared with their total revenue. Data reported here reflect extrapolation to 100% of first-tier production suppliers. Data collected for 2022 represented 94% of HP production spend.
△ This metric reports the amount of water withdrawn by suppliers, not the amount consumed by our multi-tier supply chain as reported in our water footprint. Because water withdrawn can also be returned, this footprint is inherently larger. Refers to first-tier suppliers for manufacturing, materials, and components. Withdrawal is estimated based on suppliers' reported water withdrawal and their dollar volume of HP business compared with their total revenue. The majority of these companies report on a calendar-year basis. Data reported here reflect extrapolation to 100% of first-tier production suppliers. Data collected for 2022 represented 94% of HP production spend.
△ Waste data are estimated based on suppliers' waste data and their dollar volume of HP business compared with their total revenue. The majority of these companies report on a calendar-year basis. Data reported here reflect extrapolation to 100% of first-tier production suppliers. Data collected for 2022 represented 99% of HP production spend for nonhazardous waste and 78% for hazardous waste.
