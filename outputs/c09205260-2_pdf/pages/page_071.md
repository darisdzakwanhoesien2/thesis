# Product Transportation

We aim to optimize our logistics network to enhance efficiency, lower costs, and reduce environmental impacts. Our strategy includes:

- Consolidating shipments and streamlining routes.
- Shipping directly to customers or local distribution centers.
- Minimizing reliance on air freight.

To reduce GHG emissions across our global logistics network, HP collaborates with freight partners to expand the use of sustainable fuels for ocean and air transport. Advancements in technology are accelerating the uptake of electric trucks and delivery vehicles, improving emissions profiles in the US, the EU, and Thailand.

We require our transportation suppliers to calculate GHG emissions for HP shipments using the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework. This standardized approach ensures accurate reporting with emission factors tailored to transport modes and locations. To further industry progress, we partner with the Smart Freight Centre, the Clean Cargo Working Group, and the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) SmartWay program.

In the US and Canada, we prioritize SmartWay partners for truck shipments to enhance transportation efficiency and reduce emissions. Recognizing our leadership in sustainability, HP is a 10-time recipient of the EPA SmartWay Excellence Award in the Shippers category.

# Nonproduction Suppliers

We procure a wide variety of non-production goods and services essential to our operations, including staffing, business consulting, marketing, and travel. Our engagement with indirect suppliers focuses on geographical and industry-specific risks, emphasizing collaboration to drive improvements. We support these suppliers with training programs designed to enhance reporting accuracy and reduce GHG emissions, ensuring alignment with HP's climate goals.
