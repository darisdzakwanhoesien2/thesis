Impact Report

We address our direct impacts by measuring our operational water footprint and focusing on water security.

## Water Footprint

HP's operational water footprint[22] comes from our buildings, landscaping, and production of high purity water for manufacturing purposes.

In 2024, HP withdrew 2,250,000 cubic meters of water in our operations, a 0.7% increase from 2023. Though we made operational efficiency improvements across our facilities, we experienced a major water leak in 2023 at our Penang, Malaysia, facility, which persisted into 2024 and contributed to our increased water consumption.

Water withdrawal intensity per million US dollars of net revenue increased by 1% between 2023 and 2024, due in part to decreased revenue and slight increase in water consumption.

We continue to focus on HP's withdrawal of potable water, which makes up 89% of our overall operational water withdrawal. In 2024, our global operations achieved a 38% reduction in potable water withdrawal compared with 2015. For the third consecutive year, we surpassed our goal of 35% reduction in potable water withdrawal by 2025,[23] focusing on high-risk sites. We maintained progress despite discovering and repairing a significant water leak in Malaysia. To further mitigate risk at the Malaysia site, we added 3,010 cubic meters of water storage, allowing us to continue operations without putting additional burden on municipal water demand during water shortages and shutdowns in the area.

HP's total 2024 operational water consumption[24,25] was 2,250,000 cubic meters, and from all areas identified as high or extremely high risk for water stress[26] was 317,000 cubic meters, a 13% increase over last year.

## Water Security

HP focuses on water security to manage our water-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across our operations. We reduce water consumption and address pollution and water scarcity in the regions where we operate.

To decrease water use in HP operations, we prioritize improving irrigation and building water use, as well as reusing process water at facilities in areas identified as high risk for water stress in our annual water risk assessment. We use the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool to assess the risk of sites and prioritize reductions in water-stressed locations. Using this tool, we assessed 196 HP facilities as part of our risk modeling for 2024. 93 of the facilities assessed (48% of the total) fall within the high or extremely high categories for baseline water stress. Water withdrawn at these facilities made up 14% of our total operational water withdrawal. At the 25 sites where we directly track data (representing 71% of withdrawal volume from high and extremely high risk areas), water withdrawal increased by 34,000 cubic meters, a 17% increase compared with 2023. At the other 68 sites (where water withdrawal data is extrapolated), the annual adjustment to the intensity factor resulted in an increase of 1,500 cubic meters in our estimated withdrawals year-over-year. The increased water withdrawal at our directly tracked sites was primarily a result of additional activities on the landlord's portion of our site in Boise, Idaho, US.

In support of water reduction efforts, HP recycled and reused 247,000 cubic meters of water[27] globally for use in landscaping, indoor plumbing, and as process water. This was the equivalent of approximately 10.9% of total water withdrawal. We also captured and used 2,000 cubic meters of rainwater to use in cooling towers.

HP identifies and tests for priority substances of concern in water discharge based on the EU Water Framework Directive. We monitor the quality of discharge emissions to water at all sites where monitoring is required based on local permit requirements, including our imaging and printing product manufacturing facilities. Water discharge quality at these sites is verified by an independent third party to ensure we meet or exceed all applicable legal requirements, local codes, and regulations, as outlined in the HP Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy.

Additionally, all HP operational sites are required to implement enterprise-wide procedures to prevent unauthorized pollutant discharge into wastewater and to prevent untreated wastewater discharge directly into surface water or groundwater. All HP latex inks are made in a factory using 100% reclaimed water. All water used for our latex inks undergo an in-house water treatment process to meet specifications for ink quality. The factory performs online, real time organic and inorganic testing weekly to ensure that the purity of the treated reclaimed water meets specifications.

In 2024, HP had no violations for non-compliance with local discharge limits.[28]
