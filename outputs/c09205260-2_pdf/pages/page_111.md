# Responsible Minerals

HP works diligently to avoid any association between the materials in our products and armed violence or human rights abuses. We have adopted industry-leading policies and monitoring practices and are broadening our vigilance beyond conflict minerals¹⁰ to a wider range of minerals and geographies.

Our large global supply chain presents the opportunity to significantly influence our suppliers. Through collaborative efforts, we continue to source responsibly from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).

# Transparency in Sourcing

While conflict minerals such as tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (3TG) are rarely present in large volumes in any one IT product or by any one company, they are found in relatively small amounts in virtually all electronic products. We are typically 4-10 supply chain stages removed from the smelters that purchase the ores and process them into metals. To promote transparency, we partner with peers across the IT industry and respected industry bodies and programs to collectively engage the entire supply chain in responsible sourcing, regardless of origin.

HP supports retention of the US conflict minerals reporting framework as an economic driver for smelters to responsibly source minerals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. In parallel, we support the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, which appropriately focuses on responsible smelter sourcing regardless of country of mineral origin, including CAHRAs worldwide.

We do not support de facto embargoes of minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries, or from other conflict-affected regions. We believe it is more effective to use our leverage—independently as well as through cross-industry collaborations—to address issues and promote positive change. This focus helps to protect people in those regions while maintaining their economic opportunities. We actively collaborate with industry initiatives to foster accountability, protect communities, and preserve livelihoods.
