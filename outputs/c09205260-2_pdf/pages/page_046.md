# Policies and Standards

We strive to provide protections that exceed legal minimums across our operations, inspiring employee, customer, and partner confidence when sharing personal data with us and when using our products and services.

Our rigorous policies, standards, controls, and governance are designed to keep personal data safe and respect privacy. Measures include:

- **Privacy Statement**: Our **Privacy Statement** describes privacy principles and practices as well as users' choices and rights related to personal data. Included in our principles: HP only processes personal data for the purposes described at the time of collection or for additional compatible purposes in accordance with local law. We do not use personal data for secondary incompatible purposes.

- **Internal Policies and Standards**: We maintain internal policies and standards that align with international data protection and privacy principles, covering the data life cycle. To meet the requirements of changing regulations and evolving circumstances, we continually strengthen privacy protections—implementing enhanced internal policies and procedures to address our obligations as a data controller and processor, and ensuring that data subject rights are respected. As required by law or regulation, all third parties, including suppliers, are obligated by contract to provide equivalent levels of protection and to follow our privacy policies and practices for handling personal data.

- **Privacy Policies**: Our privacy policies, which are embedded in group-wide risk/compliance management through a Compliance Assessment Program (CAP), are designed to prevent, mitigate, and remediate all compliance-related business impacts. The risks identified through the CAP are integrated into our Trust and Privacy Organization process for conducting internal and external audits of privacy policy compliance. The Trust and Privacy Organization works closely with appointed privacy leads in business teams and with the company's Cybersecurity Organization.

- **Privacy Controls Framework**: Consisting of more than 100 activities related to data protection compliance, our privacy controls framework is the core of our privacy and data protection program. It includes comprehensive internal policies, employee training, assurance and risk mitigation, an incident management process, privacy certifications, information security controls, and defined supplier contractual terms and assessment for privacy and security compliance.

- **Data Protection Officer**: Alongside our Trust and Privacy Organization, a dedicated data protection officer provides oversight and leadership of compliance and the safeguarding of personal data.

- **Binding Corporate Rules**: Our **Binding Corporate Rules** (BCRs), which have been approved by the data protection authorities of most European Economic Area countries, are intended to provide adequate guarantees that the personal data of HP employees, suppliers, and customers are safeguarded when being transferred to any HP-offiliated company.

- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance Office**: HP's HIPAA Compliance Office oversees compliance with HIPAA when triggered by our internal and external activities as a company.

In 2024, all HP employees were required to complete our privacy principles training. For the second year in a row, 99% of employees completed the course during the four-week campaign. This training is intended to reinforce HP's privacy and data protection principles and ensure that employees understand how to respect and protect the privacy of customers, employees, and partners. During the year, we also offered access to online courses that provide additional topic- and role-based training opportunities.

With the advent of new data protection laws and regulations around the world, there is a constant need to evolve operations to comply with new requirements. We continue to see an increased emphasis on data processing transparency, consent, and individual data rights. To address these changes, HP invested time and effort to establish a more streamlined approach to thoughtfully operationalize applicable legal requirements in 2024.

We continue our digital transformation journey, focusing on personal data governance and developing capabilities through technology to better manage our data ecosystem and user experiences. Additional information on privacy can be found on our website.
