# Product Security

Cybersecurity is an increasing concern for our customers worldwide, as cyberthreats continue to evolve with attacks that are more frequent, sophisticated, and diverse.

We regularly enhance HP products, solutions, and services with industry-leading threat protection, detection, and resiliency capabilities while ensuring end user and organization data privacy. Decades of security innovation underpin HP Wolf Security as HP devices fortify zero trust principles' effectiveness for our customers.

HP's leadership team oversees our portfolio-wide approach to security and provides the resources needed to support HP's continued security leadership. Our Security Advisory Board, consisting of several HP leaders as well as external advisors with broad backgrounds in offensive and defensive security, advises us on the ever-changing threat landscape, augmenting our work in HP R&amp;D and HP Labs research activities.

# Designing Processes for Security

From design through manufacturing, renewal/reuse, and recycling, HP follows security-by-design and privacy-by-design models, including zero trust principles, in the design and development of our products. We build protection, detection, and automatic recovery capabilities into our devices, not just into software, providing customers with separate, auditable security mechanisms to help manage and recover from security threats.

We design business PCs and printing systems with future threats in mind, providing built-in, hardware-enforced security and resiliency capabilities that integrate seamlessly with each organization's broader infrastructure—without requiring IT intervention. As a foundational part of our strategy, we arm our customers with the most potent security protections across devices, data, documents, solutions, and services to help them use endpoint infrastructure safely and confidently.

Additionally, we continually conduct threat analyses on new methods of compromising a PC or printing system, which in turn helps guide product security development efforts. We employ cybersecurity specialists and conduct cybersecurity architecture

reviews, penetration testing, Bug Bounty programs, code reviews, and automated code scanning, using industry-leading tools. When issues arise, we take appropriate actions to remediate reported security vulnerabilities.

Through our Bug Bounty programs, we offer rewards for highly trained, geographically diverse, ethical hackers who expose flaws in our personal systems and in our print and cartridge technologies. The program leverages deep, hard-to-find technical skills to detect obscure, previously unidentified vulnerabilities in our devices and ink/toner cartridges before they are released to market.

Our industry best practice Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure approach describes how we work with partners, the industry, and the security community to address vulnerabilities. When notified about a suspected vulnerability, we investigate thoroughly and, if it is confirmed, work with the submitter on remediation and a coordinated public release of information.

# Supply Chain Security

Throughout our manufacturing, distribution, and renew and reuse processes, HP is committed to delivering a secure product to our customers. The supply chain security life cycle begins with the selection of trusted component suppliers and manufacturing partners.

Our manufacturing facilities must meet HP partner cybersecurity standards, in line with our Defense in Depth cybersecurity strategy. During the manufacturing cycle, PC and printer software is installed in the factory using secure, HP-designed processes and validation checks. With the support of our logistics partners, HP products are secured against tampering in storage and transportation through tamper-evident packaging; hard-sided, lockable trailers; Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking with door-opening detection; and secure parking sites. These requirements help maintain product integrity through delivery.

We complete regular security reviews of our suppliers, logistics providers, and manufacturing partners, utilizing industry standards such as ISO 27001, NIST 800-161, and Transported Asset Protection Association standards.
