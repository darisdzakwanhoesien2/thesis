2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Well-Being

The holistic well-being of our employees is vital to HP's success.

Our Well Beyond employee well-being program is designed to serve the needs of our evolving workforce and culture through opportunities for employees to prioritize wellness across five pillars of well-being: emotional, financial, life balance, physical health, and social and community. In 2024, 81% of eligible employees in the US and 59% worldwide enrolled in Well Beyond.

Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors across the five pillars through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking through the Personify Health app, personal challenges, and other incentives. In the US, for example, employees and their spouses or domestic partners can receive annual incentives of up to US$600 each for activities such as completing a Wellness Assessment and tracking healthy activities.

In 2024, we launched the Elevate Your Everyday campaign, which offers HP employees the tools, support, and motivation to improve their well-being. At the beginning of the year, employees completed the Wellness Assessment, which created a personalized well-being plan, supporting them to achieve their goals. In 2024, the Wellness Assessment was completed by about 14,616 employees globally. Throughout the year, a series of events and benefits, such as Personify Health incentives, the Global Wellness Challenge, and

Financial Well-Being Month, were offered as part of the program to encourage employees to prioritize their health and wellness.

Through our well-being vendors, we offer an array of programs, activities, and virtual gatherings, as well as enhanced benefits and resources to support well-being. Offerings include sessions focused on the science behind mindfulness and ongoing virtual office hours with our medical consultants.

## Emotional

- We continue to integrate mental and emotional health into all aspects of our well-being programs. Via quarterly well-being newsletters, we promoted employee resources to reduce stress and increase resilience. We also sent a global email in honor of World Suicide Prevention Day that highlighted the importance of checking in on one's own mental health and of providing hope and support for others.
- In the US, we hosted a four-part webinar series focused on effective ways to recognize, manage, and overcome stress. The series explored common stressors in both personal and professional life and how to tackle them.
- Headspace is an award-winning, research-backed meditation and mindfulness application that HP offers to employees and their family members. In 2024, more than 20,207 employees and over 5,218 family members were enrolled.

## Financial

- HP's Financial Well-Being campaign highlighted the resources we offer to support employees with managing debt and building wealth through savings, perks, and one-to-one counseling, with the ultimate goal of helping HP employees to achieve financial security. More than 2,000 employees in the US participated in our Well Beyond Financial Well-Being Month activities in 2024. We also offered a global Financial Well-Being Fundamentals webinar in partnership with Fidelity that more than 2,000 employees attended live or via the replay.

## Life Balance

- In 2024, we offered employees a "Me Day," a fully paid day for all employees to focus on their well-being. To promote the importance of taking this day, as well as time off throughout the year, we collaborated with Headspace to host a global webinar highlighting the physical and emotional health benefits of rest and rejuvenation.

## Physical Health

- As part of our Global Wellness Challenge in May 2024, 946 employees were newly registered on the Personify Health platform, through which we provide access to digital coaching and a wide range of health and well-being content. More than 18,150 employees joined the Global Wellness Challenge, forming approximately 3,778 teams across 58 countries.
- During the Global Wellness Challenge, employees registered over 5.9 billion steps through our Well Beyond platform, equivalent to about 7,624 daily steps per participant.

## Social and Community

- HP continues our commitment to helping employees nourish connections with fellow colleagues and the world around us. Through organized groups such as the Global Well-Being Ambassador Program, Recognition Program, and Business Resource Groups (BRGs), HP helps employees feel more fulfilled, motivated, and understood.
