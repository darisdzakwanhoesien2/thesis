# Assessments

Alongside our audit program, we use assessments to identify and manage human rights risks effectively and efficiently. The following assessments are an essential part of our HRDD:

- Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs): We leverage RBA's SAQs to drive suppliers to conduct self-assessments. The responding entity is required to complete a questionnaire that is based on our SCoC. The SAQ can include from 100 to more than 400 questions that cover the entity's site characteristics and practices related to labor, health and safety, environment, business ethics, and their management system. Information obtained from the SAQ further helps HP assess risk and can determine the prioritization for an on-site audit and specialized assessment. During 2024, 337 production suppliers completed SAQs.
- Desk Assessments: Desk assessments are the basis for risk sensing to inform further levels of engagement. These assessments consider the type of service or activity we engage in, the country, the level of spend associated with the engagement, modern slavery indicators, and information we have about the entity itself.
- Specialized Assessments: We conduct targeted supplier specialized assessments to supplement our comprehensive audits, focusing on specific risk areas including vulnerable workers (e.g., student, dispatch, and foreign migrant workers) and health and safety (e.g., fire safety and emergency preparedness).

- Fire Safety Assessments: These assessments focus on identifying potential health and safety risks, such as occupational safety, emergency preparedness, and control of flammables.
- Social Assessments: Using our SCoC as the foundation, these simplified assessments for new suppliers or supplier sites help identify potential risks for what HP considers the key areas of the SCoC. The initial assessment helps prevent overwhelm for new or smaller suppliers, aims to build their maturity, and prepares them for future full audits.
- Vulnerable Worker Group (Student and Foreign Migrant Worker) Assessments: These deep-dive assessments focus on student and foreign migrant workers, who are vulnerable worker groups in the supply chain, and pinpoints potential risks during the recruitment, employment, and repatriation of workers.
- Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Validation Assessments: These assessments help verify data collected as a part of our Labor KPI Program that identifies issues such as working hours, days of rest, and student workers at high risk supplier locations in order to support ongoing improvement.
- Priority Screening Assessments: These assessments are a subset of a full RBA audit that focuses on what HP considers to be high priority risks, such as freely chosen employment, occupational safety, and hazardous substances.
