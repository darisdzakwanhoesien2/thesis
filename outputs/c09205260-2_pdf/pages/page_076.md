# Supply Chain

Supply chain water footprint refers to the total volume of water used, directly and indirectly, to produce the goods and services a company relies on. This includes water consumed and wastewater generated during supplier operations, making water footprint a key factor in assessing environmental impact and corporate sustainability.

## Water Footprint

HP assesses its supply chain water footprint by considering both first-tier (direct) upstream production supplier water consumption and multi-tier (indirect) supplier water consumption. This comprehensive approach ensures a more accurate representation of the water impact associated with our value chain.

The estimation of our supply chain water footprint is based on an economic input-output (EIO) analysis, utilizing EIO-LCA factors alongside HP's reported net revenue across different business segments. This methodology allows us to estimate water use across various industries linked to our supply chain. Additionally, our direct supplier calculations include the water consumption associated with HP paper, ensuring a holistic view of our direct operational impact.

In 2024, indirect supplier water consumption was estimated at 37,800,000 cubic meters, representing a 3% increase compared to 2023. This water consumption is entirely attributed to the power generation sector.

Meanwhile, direct supplier water consumption in 2024 was estimated at 18,000,000 cubic meters, reflecting a 3% increase from 2023. This category encompasses water use across all other sectors directly supplying HP, highlighting the broader impact of our procurement activities on global water resources.

## Supplier Engagement

Effective water resource management is a priority across our value chain, and we actively engage with suppliers to enhance water stewardship and address water-related risks. Our collaborative approach includes foundational requirements, risk assessment, reporting initiatives, and incentivized performance improvements.

HP's Supplier Code of Conduct establishes clear expectations for responsible water management, pollution prevention, resource conservation, and compliance with environmental permits. To identify and address supplier water risks, we conduct an annual water risk assessment, analyzing the locations of suppliers representing the top 95% of our procurement spend. We leverage the WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to assess water stress and risks at the river basin level, prioritizing engagement with suppliers in high-risk areas or those manufacturing water-intensive products and commodities.

Suppliers are encouraged to improve their water reporting and management practices through participation in the CDP Supply Chain Water Security program and RBA Online, where they disclose water withdrawals, discharges, risks, and management strategies. However, as primary supplier data are still maturing, they are not yet integrated into HP's corporate water footprint calculations, which still rely on estimates.

To drive meaningful improvements, HP integrates water stewardship into our Supplier Scorecard, which evaluates suppliers based on their transparency in water reporting and governance structures for water management at the executive level. The scorecard is embedded in our procurement management process, influencing business performance evaluations and ongoing supplier relationships.

Through these initiatives, we aim to foster greater accountability. Improve water management across our supply chain, and support long-term water security in the regions where we and our suppliers operate.
