# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a key pillar of our continuing digital transformation roadmap and a high priority for HP, our customers, and our stakeholders.

Our holistic approach integrates cybersecurity across the value chain, including the design, development, and delivery of our products, services, solutions, and operations. We build resiliency into our business model and work to avoid cybersecurity incidents. When cybersecurity issues do occur, we identify and resolve them rapidly, thereby protecting individuals, data, our customers, and HP.

## Policies and Standards

HP maintains consistent, rigorous cybersecurity policies, standards, and procedures to give our customers, employees, and partners confidence when sharing data with us. The HP Cybersecurity Policy Suite provides a framework for the company, informs overarching governance in this area, and underpins company-wide cybersecurity. We regularly update our policies and standards to reflect new processing activities and regulatory developments.

We educate HP employees annually about our cybersecurity policies and standards, as well as regulatory requirements, emerging threats, and new practices. Additionally, we conduct awareness and phishing campaigns throughout the year, including during Cybersecurity Awareness Month each October.

## Cybersecurity Organization

Our Cybersecurity Organization, led by HP's chief information security officer, maintains governance, processes, resources, and IT partner and vendor relationships to help identify and prevent unwanted access, security threats, and cyberattacks. The Organization also provides extensive incident response, vulnerability management, and security risk management programs across HP to support best-in-class end-to-end security throughout the enterprise.
