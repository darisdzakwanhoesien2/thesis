# Global Standards and Government Access Requests

As legislation continues to evolve, our Privacy Policy &amp; Strategy team works with governments worldwide to develop robust and globally interoperable privacy and data transfer frameworks.

HP further relies on lawful mechanisms for data transfer to enable the movement of data across jurisdictions. A description of the transfer mechanisms HP uses can be found in the International Data Transfers section of the HP Privacy Statement. In 2024, we updated our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which were reviewed and approved by the European Union Data Protection Authorities. In addition, the UK Information Commissioner Office (ICO) undertook a review of HP's BCRs and recognized them as a valid mechanism for transfers of UK residents' personal data outside of the UK.

We maintain a process to handle and document government access requests (GARs) for personal data. Under this process, our privacy counsel reviews and recommends how to address such requests in accordance with legal requirements. Ultimately, the data protection officer approves the request as appropriate and in accordance with HP's BCRs.

Per HP's commitment to privacy and transparency, this report provides information on GARs received in 2024.
