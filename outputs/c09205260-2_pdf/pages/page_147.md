# Inclusive Sourcing

As an industry leader, we take pride in recognizing the importance of inclusion in our supply chain. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive supplier base is rooted in our core values, and it plays a crucial role in driving innovation, strengthening our business, and supporting local communities.

In 2024, we continued to build a global comprehensive supplier inclusion program that focuses on supporting small businesses and companies owned by women, members of minority groups, veterans, service-disabled veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and aboriginal or Indigenous individuals. In the US, we spent a total of US$320 million with small businesses, US$169 million with minority-owned businesses, and US$96 million with women-owned businesses¹⁴ in 2024 (see data). Our supplier inclusion program had an overall economic impact of US$830 million throughout the year.

This achievement is a testament to our unwavering commitment to promoting inclusion in our supply chain. By expanding our network of suppliers and fostering relationships with under-utilized businesses, we can access a broader range of talent, expertise, and innovation. This approach not only benefits our company but also contributes to the advancement of our communities and society as a whole.

To further strengthen our supplier inclusion program, we collaborated with various organizations and industry groups, such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council, the Women's Business Enterprise National Council, Disability:IN, tech:SCALE, and WEConnect International, in 2024.

# Collaborating for an Inclusive Supply Chain

HP's commitment to supplier inclusion extends beyond our own operations and into our broader supply chain. We actively work alongside our suppliers to promote inclusive procurement practices that reflect our values and drive long-term success.

Small businesses play a critical role in fostering innovation, creating jobs, and driving economic growth. We are committed to strengthening our partnerships with small businesses by providing them with opportunities to participate in our supply chain, access new markets, and grow their capabilities. By collaborating with suppliers of all sizes, we create a more agile and competitive ecosystem that benefits not only our business but also the broader economy.

Through ongoing collaboration, we encourage suppliers to explore opportunities for engaging with small and underrepresented businesses, strengthening the overall supply ecosystem. We believe that fostering connections between large and small enterprises leads to greater innovation, supply chain resilience, and economic expansion.

By supporting partnerships that expand access and create new opportunities, we help cultivate a more resilient and innovative supply chain that benefits businesses, industries, and communities alike. Our approach ensures that companies of all sizes—including small businesses—have the resources, visibility, and support needed to thrive in an increasingly complex global marketplace.

By embedding these principles into our procurement strategy, HP remains dedicated to fostering a dynamic and equitable supply chain—one that drives innovation, strengthens business relationships, and contributes to economic empowerment on a broader scale.
