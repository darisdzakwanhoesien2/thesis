** Number of workers reached each year depends on the programs executed; some programs address issues broadly across suppliers and workers, while other programs focus more narrowly on individual supplier sites or specific vulnerable worker groups. The scope of the program includes production supplier workers, nonproduction supplier workers, workers at HP-controlled manufacturing facilities, and customer support operations.

\*\*\* Based on production-line workers at final assembly and select commodity sites participating in the HP Labor KPI Program. We continue to expand the list of suppliers in the KPI program based on business risk, country risk, and identified nonconformances.

† See Immediate priority findings for details.

\*\* These totals are the number of workers as of the date of the site visit according to production supplier initial audit and full re-audit reports.

\*\* Scores reflect performance against criteria that are updated periodically.
