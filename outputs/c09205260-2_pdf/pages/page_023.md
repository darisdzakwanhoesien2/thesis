## HP and iFixit Self-Repair Pilot

In 2023, HP launched an innovative self-repair pilot in the US with iFixit for consumer PC models.³¹ Through this program, we make HP parts, tools, and repair manuals available in the form of fix kits. This self-repair service empowers customers to effectively repair products, keeping them in use for longer. During 2024, the pilot met its learning goals with an 8.9/10 customer satisfaction score;³² leading to building a business case that expands to a wider set of products and countries.
