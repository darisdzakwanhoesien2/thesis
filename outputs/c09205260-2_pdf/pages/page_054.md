All HP-branded electrical products undergo evaluations and testing to ensure that they meet our safety standards, consistent with HP's Safe &amp; Legal Product requirements, which outline relevant internal and international safety standard requirements. HP continually evaluates our products to identify and implement opportunities for ongoing improvement.

Additionally, we share extensive product safety information online to support customers' informed purchasing decisions. View Declarations of Conformity for EU and UK requirements, as well as certifications for other locations.

The HP Sustainability and Compliance Center can also be contacted regarding declarations for other countries.

The information includes physical, chemical, and toxicological properties, regulatory details, and recommendations for safe handling.
