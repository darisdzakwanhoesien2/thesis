# Inclusion at HP

Innovation at HP comes from the different perspectives, backgrounds, knowledge, and experiences of our employees that make up our globally connected workforce.

# Strategy and Approach

By creating an inclusive environment, we strive not only for all employees to be their authentic selves at work, but also to empower them to reach their full potential and to contribute to our collective success. We aim for a workforce that represents our customers and allows us to remain responsive to the marketplace, driving innovation to meet their evolving needs.

Our strategy embeds a culture of inclusion across all parts of our business and functions. Supported by leadership, the company's global inclusion strategy is guided and influenced through collaborative efforts that focus on locally implemented processes, while ensuring organizational consistency with policies, practices, and services. Programs, strategic partnerships, and Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are key components of our strategy to attract, develop, and retain talent and provide an environment where employees feel valued and respected—and where they can innovate. According to our annual employee engagement survey, 87% of employees report that they experience an inclusive work environment at HP.

The HP Global Best Work Environment Policy is the foundation for a positive culture of inclusion and respect; it includes the Global Harassment-Free Work Environment Policy, Global Non-Discrimination Policy, and Open Door Policy.
