# Energy Efficient Products and Certifications

To help customers reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions, we focus on energy-efficient designs and offer convenient, service-based solutions. We use a variety of metrics to track progress and foster innovation as we continually refine our portfolio of products to deliver greater value to customers while minimizing environmental impact.

Additionally, we rely on third-party auditing through eco labels and certifications to validate our data, ensuring credibility and transparency in our efforts.

Energy consumed during product use is a significant contributor to our carbon and water footprints. In 2024, product energy use generated 4,362,000 tonnes of CO2e, accounting for 25% of our total carbon footprint. This represents a 46% reduction in absolute emissions compared with 2019.

## Personal Systems

From 2019 to 2024, we achieved an average reduction of 24% in the energy consumption of our personal systems products, including 35% in notebooks, 51% in workstations, and 8% in displays.[80] These improvements were driven by ongoing design advancements, such as more efficient central processing units (CPUs), panels, and power supplies, which continue to lower the typical energy use of our notebooks, workstations, and displays.

## Home and Office Printing

The HP Envy 6100/6500 All-in-One Printer series and HP DeskJet Plus Ink Advantage 6100/6500 All-in-One Printer series are designed to meet EPFAT Silver® and ENERGY STAR® performance criteria. In addition to being UL Ecologo certified,[88] compatible HP EvoMore Ink supplies are designed to have a lower carbon footprint compared with standard cartridges[89] by getting twice the number of pages.[91]

See printer eco label information, including ENERGY STAR.

## Large Format Printing

HP's DesignJet T200 and T600 Series printers incorporate the Energy Scheduler, an advanced automatic power cycling system that cuts energy consumption by 60%.[92]

In 2024, printer power off scheduler was implemented in HP Latex R series, 2700 series, 3000 series, and 1500 series, saving an average 20% of energy.

## Industrial Print

HP Indigo's advanced LEP® (Liquid ElectroPhotography) technology merges renowned digital print quality and versatility with analog-like print speeds, empowering label and packaging converters to boost productivity and sustainability. LEP® supports just-in-time production for any job length, incorporates variable data, and enables more jobs per day with fewer resources. The technology also achieves higher productivity and reduces carbon emissions by printing up to six color separations in one shot.[93]

The HP Indigo V12 Digital Press, the first to feature LEPx, can replace two to four flexo machines for mid to long runs.[94] By eliminating analog plates and makeready, it cuts time and media waste[95]—media being the primary contributor to print job carbon emissions. Digital transformation with LEPx also helps brands reduce inventory obsolescence through agile, on-demand production.

HP Brilliant Ink offers additional sustainability benefits by eliminating the need for pre-press flood coating equipment typically used to prime offset-coated media. This reduces the resources required for manufacturing, shipping, and maintenance while also saving energy during the priming and drying processes. Its optimized ink formula delivers 15-20% more pages per ink barrel[96] due to lower drop weights and higher dot gain. Furthermore, lower dryer settings reduce the energy required to dry each page.[97]
