# Waste

## HP Operations

We have the greatest influence over reducing our own operational waste and are working toward our goal to reach zero waste in our operations by 2025.⁶⁰

In 2024, HP reduced our nonhazardous solid waste by 5% in our operations, generating 23,000 tonnes⁶¹–1,100 tonnes less than in 2023. Widespread recycling and composting programs allowed us to achieve a waste diversion of 90%, up from 87%. We continued our focus on enhancing efforts to reuse office furniture across locations and to transition to permanent tableware in cafeteria operations, which supports our company-wide shift toward a circular economy of reuse, reduce, and recycle.

A few key operational waste-reduction programs in 2024 included:

- Eliminating single-use disposables: HP's Singapore headquarters replaced all single-use disposable products from office pantries, cafeteria operations, and in-house food catering services with reusable tableware and cutlery.
- Waste segregation: We tested waste-sorting accuracy in our Barcelona, Spain, and Spring, Texas, US, offices by introducing shadow boxes to display visual examples of common waste items directly above corresponding bins, helping employees place items into the proper recycling, compost, or landfill bins.
- Waste diversion: The team in our Plamex, Mexico, facility significantly increased their waste diversion, increasing their rate by 16% over the past year to achieve an 86.5% diversion rate. Key activities included appointing a dedicated Zero Waste program lead and waste-sorting staff, implementing a facility compost program near centralized trash and recycling centers, conducting a waste characterization study, tracking diversion, and hosting educational events.

## Hazardous Waste

The main sources of hazardous waste generated by HP's operations are liquid and debris from our ink-manufacturing facilities. Other types of hazardous waste include solvents used in manufacturing processes, R&amp;D waste chemicals, and other miscellaneous operational sources. A portion of the waste is considered nonhazardous in certain jurisdictions like the US, but HP includes these volumes in its hazardous waste totals. These manufacturing sites use landfill disposal as a last resort, focusing on alternatives like waste-to-energy, incineration, and solvent recovery. We generated 7,050 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2024.

See detailed waste data for 2021–2024.

See HP's latest disclosure to the US EPA Toxics Release Inventory.

HP is conducting environmental investigations or remediation at several current and former operating sites. Some historical manufacturing activities of HP and predecessor companies used chemicals now known to have contaminated soil and groundwater. We are also involved in the cleanup of sites affected by the improper disposal and recycling of HP's waste by third parties. HP works proactively to implement a variety of remediation activities in cooperation with regulatory agencies.

- HP sites report nonhazardous waste volumes and disposition based on information provided by our waste-disposal vendors. For sites unable to directly track nonhazardous waste, we estimate volumes and disposition using intensity factors based on similar operations. Segments do not add up to 100%, due to rounding.
