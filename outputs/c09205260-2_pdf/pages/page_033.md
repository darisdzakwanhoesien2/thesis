# Packaging

Our packaging strategy has three focus areas:

- Eliminate unnecessary packaging material, space, and hard-to-recycle materials, such as plastic foam.
- Innovate packaging designs to use materials with lower environmental impact, such as sustainable fiber and recycled plastics.
- Prioritize high recycled content and easily recyclable materials that can readily circulate through the economy.

Watch a video to learn how HP is tackling the plastic packaging challenge, and learn about our work to sustainably source renewable materials and counteract deforestation.

To address packaging at end-of-product life, we offer take-back services and regularly update our packaging recycling guide to help consumers avoid sending packaging materials to landfill.

# Single-Use Plastic Packaging Elimination

## 2025 GOAL

Eliminate 75% of single-use plastic packaging by 2025, compared with 2018.¹³

## 67%

reduction, from an average of 221 grams/unit in 2018 to 72 grams/unit in 2024.

# Key Initiatives in 2024

HP's circular packaging strategy centers on eliminating unnecessary and hard-to-recycle packaging material, using packaging materials with higher recycled content and lower environmental impacts, and prioritizing easily recyclable packaging materials. We also offer a packaging recycling guide to prevent HP packaging from ending up in landfills.

In 2024, HP continued to shift away from packaging made from plastic, plastic-based foam, and other hard-to-recycle materials. Through 14 product packaging redesigns, HP focused on eliminating expanded polyethylene and expanded polystyrene foam in favor of fiber-based molded pulp packaging. HP shipped 58M units in 2024 using 100% molded pulp cushions, reducing our use of expanded foam by 1,106 tonnes compared with 2023.

HP also provides compostability certificates for fiber-based packaging printed with HP PageWide C500, HP PageWide press, and HP Indigo industrial printers. These certificates confirm that the ink used by the printers will not compromise customers' abilities to compost packaging after use.
