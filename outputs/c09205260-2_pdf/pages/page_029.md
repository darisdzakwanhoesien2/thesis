# Services and Business Models for Circularity

Our service-based solutions shift product responsibility to help extend product lifespan, reduce waste, and improve circularity.

HP offers service-based solutions that shift product ownership, either to HP or to a third-party entity. This allows HP to provide more direct support for HP product protection, repair, refurbishment, reuse, and end-of-use. Solutions include:

- Managed Device Services: Provides customized end-to-end services across a product's lifecycle to maintain device functionality, including advising, configuration and deployment, device management, and refresh and renewal.
- Managed Print Services: Helps commercial customers ensure reliability and performance of their printer fleet and proactively detect and solve problems while offering printer-based emissions-reduction solutions.
- Professional Print Services: Identifies potential device issues and initiates resolutions for our large format printer customers while providing access to on-site support, repair, and maintenance services.

- Industrial Print as a Service: Offers Indigo industrial printing press customers with charge-per-print and monthly service support, which includes replacement parts and supplies as well as repair, upgrade, and end-of-life recycling services.
- All-In Plan: Enables HP to provide round-the-clock technical support to home printer customers in addition to our Instant Ink service.
- Instant Ink: Tracks ink and paper levels of HP home user and microbusiness customer printers, automatically providing cartridge and FSC-certified paper replacements.
