Impact Report

Engagement with internal and external stakeholders informs every step of our HRDD approach. Some of the engagement we carried out in 2024 includes:

|  HP Workforce | Workers in the Value Chain | Communities  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Employee feedback: Hearing from our employees is a critical component of our human rights commitments. See Employee Engagement.

Reporting concerns: All employees and third parties are able to ask questions and report ethics concerns via an online form. See Reporting Concerns.

Training: Globally, HP-supplier facing employees receive training on capacity building and awareness raising of risks, as well as HP's human rights expectations and how they can be better communicated to suppliers. See Capability Building and Training.

Global Responsible Sourcing team training: Team members on the Global Responsible Sourcing team receive trainings and proactive learnings from membership work groups and attend membership working groups and international forums including:
• 6-week training program on Business and Human Rights. During the cross-regional workshops, the team was updated on regulatory requirements, and insights of effective HRDD frameworks, reporting mechanisms, and effective remediation strategies were shared and discussed.
• The Mekong Club on modern slavery risks in Asia.
• BSR working group seminars and BSR Human Rights Working Group Asia-Pacific (APAC) sessions in Singapore.
• The OECD Responsible Minerals Forum 2024 in France.
• The Institute for Human Rights and Business Responsible Recruitment Forum in the UK.
• In person and virtual Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) forums, working groups, and educational seminars in Malaysia.
• Asia ESG Forum 2024 in Singapore. | Targeted and priority training and capability building: We work to provide training opportunities to workers and management in manufacturing, customer support, and other nonproduction suppliers. See Capability Building and Training.

Direct worker voice: Direct worker voice is heard via the MillionMakers program, the Worker Well-Being Survey, and our grievance mechanisms. Also, during every audit, private worker interviews are conducted at each site. The number of interviews performed during an audit will be dependent on the number of workers per site.

Collaborative industry initiatives and memberships: We engage with workers in the value chain through the RMI, RBA, during audits, via trainings, and through our grievance mechanisms. Most of our top US long-haul carriers are members of Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT) and we encourage all carriers to complete TAT training. We also engage through our relationships with NGOs, which support us in better understanding local or industry specific contexts such as First Mile, a program of WORK in Haiti.

Supplier Summit: HP organizes an annual Supplier Summit, which was attended by over 250 supplier representatives in 2024. During the event, HP's chief sustainability officer delivered a presentation on supply chain responsibility, highlighting the evolving regulatory expectations and their key changes, like the importance of due diligence in relation to the environment and human rights. | Minerals: HP supports the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM), and Alliance for Responsible Mining, three organizations with complementary approaches to encouraging responsible mineral sourcing. These organizations engage with affected communities by setting standards and supporting responsible sourcing practices that prioritize social and environmental wellbeing (e.g., IRMA requires that affected communities are consulted, and encourages them to participate in the independent audits that transparently grade mines against the IRMA best practice mining standard). Learn more about the responsible minerals program.

Circularity: HP works closely with, and is a brand partner of, the Responsible Sourcing Initiative and First Mile, a program of WORK. These expert and specialist organizations (together with their partners) engage affected communities by creating pathways to safer, ethically managed supply chains, particularly in high-risk regions. Learn more about our mitigation efforts in Recycling and End of Life.

Human Rights Defenders: HP's human rights defenders series supports several organizations including the Global Fund for Women, Child Rights Connect, and Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact. These organizations engage affected communities by supporting grassroots initiatives and advocating for the rights of groups that face multiple forms of discrimination or challenges, such as women, children, and Indigenous communities.
