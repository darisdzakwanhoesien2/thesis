# HP Operations¹¹

In 2024, HP operations were conducted in 55 countries and 196 sites, generating 127,600 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions—a 13% reduction from 2023, driven by increased renewable electricity procurement. Emissions intensity decreased to 2.4 metric tonnes of CO2e per million US dollars of net revenue in 2024, a 13% decrease from 2023. See detail.

Most of our operational emissions stem from the energy required to power our facilities. To address this, our strategy focuses on three key areas, including:

- Reducing energy consumption through optimization and efficiency initiatives.
- Increasing onsite renewable energy generation.
- Procuring renewable energy from offsite sources for regions where we operate.
