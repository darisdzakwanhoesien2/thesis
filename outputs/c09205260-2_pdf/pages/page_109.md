# Preventing Modern Slavery

To address the potential risks of modern slavery, we start with our own operations and suppliers while striving to collaborate more broadly in ways that drive positive change.

Modern slavery can manifest in multiple ways, including through debt bondage, forced labor, and human trafficking. We continually deepen our understanding of the social and economic factors that lead to labor concerns, and we focus on areas of risk where we can have the most influence. To promote long-term, scalable solutions, we collaborate with organizations and government agencies with local expertise.

In 2024, we partnered with stakeholders including:

- TAT: TAT educates, equips, empowers, and mobilizes members of key industries and agencies across North America to identify and report potential human trafficking situations via calls to local law enforcement and human trafficking reporting hotlines. As a proud Gold Level sponsor of the organization, we also encourage our logistics providers to promote TAT training. A partner since 2016, HP is one of TAT's leading partners in the technology and shipping space, and we have been identified by TAT as a pioneering example of bringing exposure to the issue of human trafficking in our industry.

- The Mekong Club: The Mekong Club creates sustainable practices to address modern slavery across the globe. As a member, HP has access to a range of benefits, including anti-slavery tools, resources, and consultations. We also participate in various working groups and educational sessions, collaborating with other brands on joint initiatives that address modern slavery in Asia, specifically in relation to recruitment practices and the logistic sector.

Additional details on our efforts to address modern slavery can be found in our Modern Slavery Transparency Statement.

HP's unique products require a vast network of suppliers and partners spanning six continents and over 41 countries and territories. We comprise more than 700 manufacturing suppliers and several thousand non-manufacturing suppliers that range from multinational enterprises to small firms; we depend on them to provide us with materials, components, and assembly for our products, support shipping and delivery to our customers, and supply a wide variety of other goods and services.

We were the first IT company to publicly disclose a list of our suppliers, which includes the names and locations of the suppliers that represent 95% of our production supplier spend. For our final assembly suppliers, we estimate that 45-55% of all workers are women and 10-20% are migrant workers. For our commodities suppliers, we estimate that 45-55% of all workers are women and 0-10% are migrant workers.

The multi-year agreements that we have in place with many of our suppliers allow us to build supplier awareness and capability to meet our supply chain responsibility expectations, including the implementation of and adherence to policies and processes that address human rights-related risks. In turn, our manufacturing and non-manufacturing suppliers are required to communicate our expectations to their upstream suppliers.
