# Supplier Audits and Assessments

HP uses audits and specialized assessments to help us review supplier performance and identify where corrective action is needed. We prioritize supplier audits and assessments according to risk levels. Our approach includes engaging with a range of different entities, using audit standards and procedures to assess performance, to complete corrective action as applicable, and to integrate learnings into our capability-building and prevention programs.

## Audits

We conduct both announced and unannounced audits of our manufacturing suppliers against our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). The scope of on-site audits depends on the nature of the work performed by the entity and the nature of prioritized risks. The objective of an unannounced audit is to visit preemptively in order to assess, identify, and mitigate potential risks without prior notice. These audits are a useful tool to help ensure a more comprehensive understanding of day-to-day management at our suppliers, and they may also be used to investigate allegations.

For non-manufacturing suppliers, we may conduct audits only covering those portions of the SCoC that are relevant for the operation. For example, suppliers that provide labor or services in an office environment would be evaluated for the labor and ethics portions of the SCoC.

## HP and the Responsible Business Alliance

HP is a founding member of, and has Full Member status in, the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the world's largest industry coalition dedicated to responsible business conduct in global supply chains. We implement the RBA Code of Conduct within our operations and our supply chains, and the RBA Code of Conduct is the basis for our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is how we communicate our human rights requirements to those we contract.

We leverage the RBA Validated Assessment Program (VAP) and audit protocol for all audits we conduct involving the SCoC. Audits are conducted by RBA-certified auditors, contracted qualified auditing firms, or HP auditors. This standardized protocol ensures that the process for conducting audits, interpreting findings, rating results, and instigating corrective actions is both consistent and comparable.

For example, the audit protocol requires the auditor to conduct a management system (policies and procedures) review to assess how the entity manages its operation. The auditor then examines records and data, capturing information and evidence that enable the implementation of policies and procedures to be assessed. Finally, the auditor conducts interviews with workers and supervisors to assess the rights-holders' perspectives and experiences working in the facility. This worker feedback is examined to help identify issues that may need improvement. Through this systematic assessment against the SCoC, findings are determined by triangulating the information learned from each part of the assessment. A closing meeting is held by the auditors with the entity's management team to brief them on a summary of the audit findings. A detailed audit report is prepared, which summarizes the actual findings and gaps with the SCoC. The supplier provides a detailed corrective action plan addressing all identified nonconformances, and

HP works with the entity's management to address the issues identified and confirms remedy with the employees in a closure audit. Read more on Corrective Action Plans.

As part of conducting due diligence and engagement with our partners, suppliers, and employees, we look to identify recurring issues, gaps, or challenges in performance that need to be systematically addressed. Integrating this knowledge into our communications, training, and capability building helps to better prevent and mitigate risks. Through our collaborations with the RBA and others, we work to build industry tools, standards, and training to support continuous improvement.
