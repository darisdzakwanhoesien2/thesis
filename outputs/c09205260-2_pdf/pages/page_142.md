Employee feedback is a critical component of our journey to create a Future Ready HP. We regularly collect feedback from employees to better understand and improve their experiences, and to identify opportunities to strengthen our culture.

Employees can share feedback in a variety of ways, including through our annual Voice Insight Action (VIA) survey and periodic Quick Clicks pulse surveys. In 2024, 90% of employees participated in our annual VIA employee engagement survey.
