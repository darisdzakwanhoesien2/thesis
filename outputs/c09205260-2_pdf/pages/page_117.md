# Grievance Mechanisms

HP maintains a strong culture of open communication and offers multiple accessible channels for all employees and third parties, including workers in our supply chain, to ask questions and report concerns directly to HP. These points of access include an online form: global in-country, 24-hour, toll-free phone lines (available internally and externally) with translation; text messaging (in the US); mail; and in person. Concerns or feedback related to human rights can also be sent to humanrights@hp.com.

These various channels enable equal access to and participation in our grievance mechanism, minimizing technical and financial barriers to access. We also offer anonymous reporting options where allowed by law. We encourage anyone with a concern to speak up without fear of retaliation. An overview of the grievance channels and processes is included in the annual Integrity at HP training for employees, and it is shared in capability building training to enable suppliers' workers to effectively and promptly raise any concerns.

Investigations in response to grievances lodged are conducted in a comprehensive, objective manner, and are free from influence by HP management or by our business partners. All investigations follow a process designed to ensure consistency and fairness. The investigation process may involve interviews, formal reporting, and recommendations under the oversight of our Integrity or Global Responsible Sourcing team, external human rights experts, human resources, legal, and relevant management. We do not tolerate retaliation against people who use our grievance mechanisms or otherwise raise human rights-related concerns, and we expect the same from our business partners. See Reporting Concerns.

Consistent with the UNGPs, we are committed to providing for and cooperating in effective remediation through legitimate processes. We work with responsible parties, encouraging them to assess conditions and implement corrective actions. We also seek to address adverse impacts through collaboration with peers, partners, and suppliers on collective remedies.

To test building a scalable, accessible, supplier-focused grievance mechanism aligned with emerging law and stakeholder expectations, in 2024, we piloted a third-party mechanism in several specific regions for HP suppliers in the Philippines. We partnered with Enodo Rights, a human rights advisory firm; Uluis, an experienced worker-voice provider (now part of EcoVadis); and IDEALS, a Philippine civil society organization providing critical local support. The pilot design and launch process included engagement with diverse stakeholders, such as local NGOs, worker representatives, and national and international government representatives.

The pilot program offered workers multiple channels to safely lodge complaints, including online, over the phone, and in person through dedicated off-site outreach sessions. Learnings were provided on meaningful accessibility, including building stakeholder trust and awareness while scaling across the value chain.

We also expanded our supply chain grievance mechanism by partnering with a third-party service provider to implement a dedicated worker hotline at two key manufacturing sites. This program included comprehensive, multi-lingual training delivered in Thai, Burmese, and Khmer to drive accessibility for all workers. While the initial phase reached 30% of the workforce, we have established a model to continue scaling this initiative, further demonstrating our commitment to providing workers with trusted channels to raise concerns.

HP will continue integrating these lessons to develop a grievance mechanism model from which supply chain workers can further benefit. We are focused on building worker trust and empowerment while aligning with upcoming regulatory requirements.
