# Water

Water is a vital and increasingly scarce resource that plays a critical role in ecosystems, communities, and economies worldwide. We recognize the importance of understanding and managing our water footprint comprehensively—encompassing our direct operations, supply chain, and the water-related emissions linked to product use.

HP was one of the first global IT companies to disclose a complete water footprint, and we calculate, disclose, and work to reduce water use across our business. We continuously assess and improve our water management practices, striving to reduce consumption and enhance efficiency across all areas of our business. Through collaboration with suppliers and industry partners, we drive sustainable water use and contribute to global water conservation efforts.

By integrating robust measurement methodologies and leveraging innovative solutions, we aim not only to reduce our own impact but also to support broader efforts in water security and sustainability.

In 2024, our water footprint equaled 96,078,000 cubic meters, 2% less than in 2023.

See HP's comprehensive water footprint data in Data: water footprint, and learn more about our water-related risks, impacts, and opportunities through our 2024 CDP Water Security response, the most recent dataset available at the time of report publication.
