# Ceasing, Preventing, and Mitigating Adverse Impacts

We implement measures to cease, prevent, and mitigate actual and potential adverse impacts on human rights, and we support suppliers in doing the same.

Our approach to ceasing, preventing, and mitigating actual and potential adverse human rights impacts includes several components outlined in the following sections.

## Supplier Scorecard

Our Supplier Scorecard sets expectations, incentivizes, and drives improved performance through consistent, comprehensive, and actionable feedback. This tool provides suppliers with scores that encompass audit performance, supply chain due diligence, capability building programs, conflict minerals management and environmental management, transparency, goal setting, and performance. Results are summarized across multiple dimensions and contribute to a supplier's overall procurement score, which impacts the supplier's relationship with HP and ongoing business.

Suppliers that have exceptional performance in these areas can realize a benefit in their commercial relationship with HP. Scorecards are discussed as part of regular business performance evaluations throughout the year. Revised periodically to reflect HP's increasing expectations and emerging regulations, the Scorecard process encourages continuous supplier improvement. HP leaders within our supply chain operations team are briefed on suppliers' Scorecard results. In 2024, the program was expanded, increasing the number of supplier sites by more than 150% compared with the previous year. Scorecards applied to suppliers representing 66% of our production spend.

## Corrective Action Plans

Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) are a key element of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and HP's own assurance process, which evaluates our suppliers' adherence to responsible business practices, including human rights and EHS standards. Where risks are identified during audits or assessments, we work with suppliers to address findings and enact risk-mitigation plans. The supplier is required to provide a detailed CAP 30 days after the receipt of the audit report (except immediate priority findings, which are addressed expeditiously), including the identification of root cause, the immediate containment actions, and the planned actions of all identified nonconformances.

Depending on the finding, the supplier will be given different timelines to report on progress and completion of the corrective action, varying from 30 days from the discovery of the findings to 180 days from the receipt of the audit report. HP regularly supports the suppliers in this process by reviewing their CAPs, providing suggestions to improve the impact of their action plans, following up on progress, and, once completed, requesting a closure audit to validate and confirm that the issue has been resolved. HP keeps updated records of all CAPs and the progress against them to ensure continuous improvement. When progress is inadequate, we intervene to help create a more effective plan. See the RBA VAP Standard for additional detail.

Immediate priority findings[49] are the most serious type of direct supplier nonconformance and require immediate action. In 2024, we identified three immediate priority findings, equivalent to 2% of findings on average for each initial audit and full re-audit of production suppliers. There were two issues related to the charging of recruitment fees, and one supplier withholding passports and charging recruitment fees. We required the issues to be addressed immediately and are working with the suppliers to complete remediation and implement corrective actions. Out of the three immediate priorities identified, 100% have a corrective action plan completed.

In 2024, audited suppliers show no major nonconformance related to child labor risks, continuing this trend over four years. In addition to our review of our audit data, our Labor KPI Program indicates 100% conformance to our expectations. We attribute these results to our robust capability-building program, which involves training suppliers on our expectations regarding human rights and child labor.
