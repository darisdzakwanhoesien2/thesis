# Driving Sustainable Sales and Impact with Our Channel Partners

In 2021, we launched Amplify Impact, the first sustainability program for IT channel partners.

A PLIFY

IMPACT

HP PARTNER PROGRAM

Informed by our own sustainability expertise, investments, and initiatives—and aligned with our Sustainable Impact strategy—Amplify Impact is designed to accelerate change across the IT industry and to support our partners in driving sustainability sales and impact.

Sustainability is a key IT sales differentiator. Increasingly, it is a mandatory criteria for IT tenders. Customers want to purchase products with sustainability attributes from trusted HP partners—and those partners want to build sustainable businesses and earn loyal customers. A survey of Amplify Impact partners showed a 71% increase in tender win rate and a doubling of sustainable sales won annually due to the program.

Customers benefit significantly when their suppliers and partners have empowered their workforce with a deepened understanding of sustainability and an enhanced ability to offer sustainable products and solutions. Knowing that their partner or supplier is guided by HP's sustainability leadership and advocacy provides customers with confidence that their own sustainability goals are being supported by a trusted and forward-thinking ecosystem.

More than 4,500 partners—representing over 80% of HP channel partner revenue—are enrolled and benefiting from this world-class program. We have exceeded our objective to enroll at least 50% of channel partners by 2025.

To support channel partners on their journey, Amplify Impact includes:

- A sustainability self-assessment and personalized comprehensive report, which provides partners with actionable insights, industry best practices, and resources (including peer-to-peer comparison). 90% of partners report that they highly value these personalized recommendations.

- The Amplify Impact Hub, which offers customized sustainability support with over 25 initiatives, trainings, consultancy, and personalized tracking to drive our partners' sustainability sales and impact.

- HP University, which offers a comprehensive sustainability sales training curriculum. More than 2,400 Amplify Impact partners have completed over 162,000 HP sustainability training courses.

- Support for partners with sustainability bids from the HP Sustainability and Compliance Center, along with exclusive sales support materials.

Amplify Impact has received industry recognition and several awards, including champion status in the Canalys (part of Omdia) 2025 Sustainable Ecosystem leadership matrix. The program also won Computer Reseller News (CRN's) Global Flagship Award—Sustainability Vendor of the Year 2024—and was a finalist for the 2023 World Sustainability Awards.
