# Our Mission

Across the globe, HP is accelerating access to technology, digital literacy and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and digital skills content. By ensuring greater access to digital skills and economic opportunity, we aspire to equip disconnected adolescents and adults with the critical skills needed for the Future of Work.¹ While our efforts are far from complete, we are honored to have ushered forward many inspiring stories of positive impact through direct engagement and partnerships to increase scale.

HP continues to leverage its global influence to create both human and economic value. With a strong focus on digital equity, strategic industry partnerships, and public policy advocacy, we are advancing the Future of Work. As socioeconomic divides widen around the world and society becomes increasingly reliant on digital skills and access, HP is committed to bridging these gaps. Through initiatives such as HP HOPE, HP LIFE, and the HP Digital Equity Accelerator, we have partnered with exceptional nonprofit organizations embedded in disconnected communities to help scale their impact by expanding access to technology and delivering digital and AI-focused workforce development.

Building on HP's technology, hands-on training, mentoring, and technical consultations, we are applying our expertise, systems, solutions, and financial resources to empower communities and cultivate a Future Ready workforce—equipping individuals with the capabilities they need today to thrive tomorrow.
