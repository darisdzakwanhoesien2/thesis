# Engaging with Human Rights Defenders

Human rights defenders (HRDs) are individuals or groups who act to promote and protect human rights, often in the face of adversity and danger. They may include activists, community leaders, journalists, and organizations working to uphold civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. Despite their crucial role in advancing social justice and accountability, HRDs face significant risks globally, including threats, harassment, arbitrary detention, and even killings. These dangers are particularly true for marginalized groups such as Indigenous peoples and children, who are increasingly targeted due to their advocacy efforts in climate justice and human rights. By prioritizing support for vulnerable groups of HRDs, we aim not only to empower them to participate meaningfully in social justice efforts but also to address the unique challenges they encounter.

Confronting the challenges faced by HRDs is undeniably complex for companies like HP, given our global supply chain and multiple industry touchpoints. This subject requires global collaboration and initiatives to drive meaningful, lasting change. By supporting several initiatives across different targeted vulnerable groups—all of which aim to enhance digital security and capacity-building for HRDs—HP is taking meaningful steps toward promoting digital equity in the technology space.

In 2024, HP undertook several initiatives to support HRDs:

- We updated our Human Rights Policy to explicitly reference the importance of protecting HRDs. This update demonstrates HP's commitment to recognizing and addressing the unique challenges faced by these individuals and communities.

- Starting in 2023 and continuing in 2024, HP supported a project with the Global Fund for Women aimed toward providing vulnerable HRDs with training and digital security tools to mitigate risks such as online harassment, cyberattacks, and digital surveillance. Two organizations—the Organizacion Nacional de Mujeres Indigenas Andinas y Amazonicas del Perú (ONAMIAP) and Ashanti Perú—were engaged for peer learning and skill-sharing sessions on digital security.

- We supported a second project with the Global Fund for Women, which focused on monitoring emerging social movements in Thailand through the Gender Justice Data Hub. This initiative provides funding and engages with partners such as the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW) to amplify the voices of activists working on LGBTQ+ rights and women's welfare.

- We sponsored a project with Child Rights Connect, an organization that is spearheading efforts to enhance the digital participation and protection of its Children's Advisory Team (CAT). This work includes a needs assessment survey and the establishment of child-friendly online safety protocols, ensuring that child advisors can engage safely in discussions regarding their rights and the implementation of their advocacy efforts.

- We launched our most recent project with the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Asia-Pacific. The project's focus is to empower Indigenous youth in the Philippines and Bangladesh and aims to address the intersectional risks posed by climate change, which disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. Training modules have been developed to enhance the digital and climate skills of Indigenous youth, empowering them to advocate for their rights and lead sustainable initiatives in their communities.

- HP has contributed to Cultural Survival's initiatives through the Keepers of the Earth Fund and Capacity Building programs. Thanks to this partnership, Cultural Survival was able to assist Quechua, Lenca, and Mixtec Indigenous human rights defenders facing threats due to their activism. Additionally, HP's support enabled Cultural Survivor to host the first gathering of Indigenous women defenders in the Amazon Basin, with the objective of developing skills and knowledge in digital security, to protect themselves and their communities.

It is essential that HRDs can safely engage in advocacy without fear of violence, harassment, or discrimination. By focusing on particularly vulnerable groups and ensuring that HP's expectations for its own value chain are clear and public, these initiatives play a vital role in supporting the prevention, mitigation, and cessation of potential human rights harms to HRDs.
