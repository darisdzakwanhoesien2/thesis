2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Empower Customer Sustainability continued

85 Life-cycle assessment (LCAs) are validated by a third-party to conform to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, and are used by HP to understand the total carbon footprint for HP personal systems products. Using these data, along with the information unique to each customer (e.g., product ship-to-location, product portfolios), we calculate the total carbon emissions for a customer's fleet. HP then purchases and retires carbon offsets procured through Climate Impact Partners, which certifies HP's Carbon Neutral Computing Services in accordance with its Carbon Neutral Protocol (https://www.calcomendral.com/the-carbon-neutral-protocol). Please review this document for complete details (https://www3.isp.com/td/2006/td/UseDocument.aspx?document=200430103).

86 The average energy consumption of HP products was estimated annually between 2018 and 2024 using high-volume products for all components. The average cost per product, delivery, all-in-one, workstation, and thin-client computers, as well as displays, and using energy consumption values in 15% due to ENERGY STAR being an NA-managed ecolated. Averages are calculated using the most heavily loaded ENERGY STAR configuration as a representative for individual platforms, weighted by products sold.

87 Based on US EPA/ITT registrations according to IEEE 1680.1-2018 EPB/IT 215.97 status varies by country. Visit www.epeat.net for more information.

88 Models of the HP Envy 6100/6500 series that are ENERGY STAR certified in North America are identified as HP Envy 6700e All-in-One Printer and HP Envy 6500e All-in-One Printer. Visit www.energystar.gov/productfinder for more information.

89 Original HP list Cartridge certification to UL 2801 demonstrates compliance with a range of multi-attribute, life-cycle-based criteria related to human health and environmental considerations. See UL.com/EL &amp; ResponsibleBusiness.com/HPlistUL.

90 HP 654/5/40044-54 Cartridges have a lower carbon footprint compared with standard HP 58 Original list Cartridges when normalized to print 5300 pages. Based on LC4 study conforming to ISO 14040/44 and third-party verified. See Ecolitters LC4 report.

91 HP 654/5/40044 Original list Cartridges compared with HP 58 standard Original list Cartridges. Page yield test(s) in HP Envy 6700e All-in-One printer. Average continuous printing yield of black and composite (carry-magnet/yellow) based on ISO/EC 24771 or HP testing methodology. Actual yield varies considerably based on content of printed pages and other factors. For details, see hpcsmdp/AnomalousSupplies.

92 The percentage reductions in energy consumption are based on tests conducted by HP in 2024. Data based on the implementation of auto-recheduled and IP usage in various printer models, measured on a monthly basis. Actual average may vary depending on the specific usage patterns, printer models, and environmental conditions.

93 Electricity measurement indicates consistent consumption up to six-color prints of 120 meters/minute. The carbon footprint associated with electricity usage is unchanged regardless of the number of colors, ranging from one to six.

94 Based on HP analysis of customer operations data collected during 2023-2024, the number of jobs producible in one shift on an HP Indigo V12 Digital Press is two to four times higher than using a floor press. This is due to the speed disparity between the HP Indigo V12 Digital Press and average floor presses, as well as higher HP Indigo V12 Digital Press utilization.

95 HP analysis of customer operations data, as well as HP financial analysis, shows that the production of 200 jobs/month on a floor press can generate about 13,000 square meters of media waste. By shifting jobs from analog to digital, the HP Indigo V12 Digital Press reduces waste substantially compared to floor printing.

96 Statistics of 15-20% loss ink was generated using the Ink Estimator.

97 Presses using BSO HP Brilliant Ink should be able to run faster or use lower dryer settings to achieve the same page output on inkjet media. Minimal optimizer needed for Cube PRO media.

# Transform HP's Value Chain

1 Absolute reduction of Scope 1, 2, and 3 G+C emissions compared to 2019. Excludes non-HP paper consumed during product use. As of November 2024 these goals were approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI). SBTI validated long term target is for 90% reduction in Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2040.

2 Fiber by weight will be certified to third-party standard, with preference to TGCs, or recycled.

3 HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays are derived from certified and recycled sources, with a preference for Forest Stewardship Council ("FSC") certification. Packaging is the box that comes with the product and all paper-based materials inside the box.

4 During 2024, HP brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays equaled 8% of our fiber footprint. We calculate the annual tonnage for paper used in our products and print services that will be addressed through projects with civil society forestry organizations to counteract possible deforestation by taking the estimated total annual tonnage of paper consumed on the use of our printing products and print services minus the weight of such items that we mitigate through our responsible sourcing programs. See the HP Forest positive accounting manual.

5 All HP brand paper is derived from certified sources. Paper-based packaging for PCs, displays, home and office print, and supplies is reported by suppliers as recorded or certified, with a minimum of 97% by volume verified by HP. Packaging is the box that comes with the product and all paper-based materials inside the box. Packaging for commercial, industrial, and 3D products, scanners, personal systems accessories, and spare parts is not included.

6 Excludes new time pricing HP offer 1 January 2024 (although all new times are given 30 days to complete integrity at HP New Hire training as part of their mandatory unboarding process).

7 Carbon and water footprint data presented in this section related to our production suppliers (except for HP brand paper) is calculated using product life-cycle assessment-based estimates for materials extraction through manufacturing and product transportation. Production supplier G+D emissions and water withdrawal data presented in Supply Chain Environmental Impact is based on a different methodology.

8 "Torned" refers to metric tons.
