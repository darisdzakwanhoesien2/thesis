# Life Cycle Assessment

HP uses life cycle assessments (LCAs) and product carbon footprinting (PCF) $^{82}$ to quantify the environmental impacts of our products, analyze possible alternatives, and target product performance improvements that deliver value to our customers and to our businesses.

We have conducted LCAs and PCFs for hundreds of products over the last several years, spanning our product portfolio. We are expanding this product coverage by adding new products to our LCA scope, with a focus on personal systems accessories, print hardware, and supplies. Simultaneously, we are working to improve the overall quality, traceability, and consistency of reported data.

As we develop and expand our service-based models—which were refer to as circular business solutions—we will continue to study and quantify the potential they have to reduce environmental impacts and drive progress toward a more circular and net-zero carbon economy.

HP's environmental impact assessments are made in accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040 and ISO 14044. All impact estimates involve some level of reasonable assumptions and uncertainty, resulting largely from industry-wide data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, we developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP process and product data as well as high-quality LCA data. We strive to provide the most accurate environmental impact data, but some level of uncertainty will remain, and results should be considered accordingly.

## 97%

direct match of Inkjet and Laserjet printers assessed in FY24.

## 94%

direct match of commercial business personal systems products assessed in FY24.

In 2024, we:

- Conducted or updated 345 LCAs of DesignJet printers, scanners, enterprise printers, and cartridges.
- Conducted or updated 658 PCFs of business HP desktops, notebooks, tablets, workstations, thin clients, all-in-one computers, and displays.
- Standardized assumptions for lifetime prints of legacy products, directly boosting the share of products assessed through LCAs.
- Incorporated more detailed and reliable data sources into the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) for HP's peripheral businesses.
- Refined the LCA model for inkjet supplies to align with the latest manufacturing practice for printheads.

## HP Carbon Neutral Computing Services

As part of our ongoing efforts to measure and reduce the environmental impact of our products, we help organizations achieve their climate goals through HP's Carbon Neutral services. These initiatives track and offset the carbon footprint of eligible commercial HP products through certified global programs, ensuring that devices remain carbon neutral throughout their entire lifecycle. $^{83,84,85}$
