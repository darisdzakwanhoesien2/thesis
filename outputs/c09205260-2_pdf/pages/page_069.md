# Supply Chain

Our production and nonproduction suppliers are essential partners as we work to drive net-zero carbon throughout the value chain. In 2008, HP was the first major IT company to publish aggregated supply chain GHG emissions data. We continue working to drive progress in this area, including through our goals.

Production and nonproduction suppliers play a crucial role in helping us to achieve net-zero carbon and enhance resource efficiency across the value chain. Partnering with our suppliers has been a crucial part of our strategy, as their operations directly influence energy consumption, material efficiency, and waste reduction. For over a decade, we have collaborated closely with our production and nonproduction suppliers to strengthen their environmental initiatives and to ensure transparent progress reporting, focusing on GHG emissions and energy use, water withdrawal, and waste generation.

Through our Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain membership, we request that 98% of our production suppliers, along with key strategic nonproduction suppliers, provide detailed qualitative and quantitative information on their environmental management practices and impacts. This includes data on GHG emissions and reduction targets, total and renewable energy usage, water withdrawal, climate and water-related risks, and governance structures.

We support suppliers by sharing best practices, setting clear sustainability expectations, and providing resources for adopting cleaner technologies. Our Supplier Sustainability Requirements, which includes our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) and General Specification for the Environment (GSE), outlines our expectations for suppliers that we contract with.

We collaborate with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to enhance its industry-wide Code of Conduct, helping to elevate standards across IT supply chains. Our involvement includes contributing to the latest RBA Code revision (published in January 2024), which also forms the basis of our Supplier Code of Conduct. This update introduces new requirements for:

- Setting and publicly reporting progress on absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction goals.
- Public reporting on significant Scope 3 emission categories.
- Tracking and documenting hazardous and non-hazardous waste data.

Our SCoC encompasses environmental provisions covering permits, reporting, pollution prevention, waste reduction, hazardous substances, water management, air emissions, and energy and GHG emissions reduction. We enforce these standards through the RBA Validated Assessment Program and our internal assurance and audit processes. Furthermore, suppliers and their subcontractors are required to acknowledge and implement the SCoC, ensuring a cascading effect throughout the supply chain.

Environmental performance, as measured by our internally developed Supplier Scorecard, is a key component of regular business reviews with our suppliers and is deeply integrated into our procurement management process. Additionally, we apply more stringent requirements through this Scorecard to suppliers that assemble our products, as well as suppliers within each commodity group, particularly focusing on suppliers with higher potential for environmental impacts, including:

- Current renewable electricity use and future commitments.
- GHG emissions performance reporting and science-based GHG emissions reduction targets.
- Water use reporting and water quality targets.
- Materials disclosure for HP product parts.
- Transparency through CDP and HP annual energy survey.

By combining the SCoC requirements with the Supplier Scorecard, we have created a multi-faceted approach to drive environmental responsibility throughout our supply chain. This strategy ensures that our suppliers not only meet baseline standards but also actively work towards more ambitious sustainability targets, aligning with our company's broader environmental objectives.
