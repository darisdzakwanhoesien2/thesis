# Capability Building and Training

HP is building upon our existing human rights compliance model through deeper engagement and partnership with our suppliers and their workers. This engagement involves further incorporating suppliers and their workers into our systems, and continuing to drive dignity and respect for every individual across our value chain. To support mitigation, cessation, and prevention of human rights risks, we prioritize developing environments that support worker well-being, elevate workers' voices, and promote workers' agency.

Our mitigation efforts involve ensuring that workers are aware of their human rights, as well as developing work and life skills that enable them to pursue wider career options while improving their quality of life. This approach is intended to mitigate and prevent potential risks from being realized and to empower workers with the confidence to know how and where to exercise their rights.

It is essential that our suppliers understand and uphold HP's human rights expectations and commitments, and that they cascade these high standards to their own suppliers. Preventing human rights abuses requires clear communication and shared responsibility, ensuring that our standards are consistently applied throughout our supply chain. This approach may also result in reduced turnover rates, as well as improved communication for suppliers, further preventing potential risks.

# Training HP Employees on Human Rights

In 2024, 99.4% of employees (including senior executives) completed annual integrity at HP training, which includes human rights-related content such as anti-harassment, non-discrimination, and anti-corruption. An internal website provides human rights-related materials and resources for HP's sales organization, and we maintain an awareness video detailing human rights and why they matter.

In 2024, HP deployed a training on a monthly cadence to inform procurement teams—which work closely with vendors and suppliers—about the latest human rights laws and regulations, as well as how procurement can help ensure responsible procurement through initiatives launched from the Global Human Rights team. Feedback from these monthly sessions shows that participants feel more confident on human rights topics and the HP human rights requirements for suppliers.

# Training Value Chain Partners on Human Rights

Our commitment to training is not limited to our own employees. We provide training opportunities to workers and management in manufacturing, customer support, and other nonproduction suppliers. In collaboration with NGO partners and other external organizations, we provide training designed to help suppliers continually improve their sustainability commitments, including worker rights and EHS awareness.

During 2024, we conducted several capability-building, awareness, and training programs for over 122,500 workers in the value chain, including:

- Human Rights 101 Training &amp; Your Rights to Safe &amp; Fair Working Conditions: We offered a worker rights training to suppliers, primarily focusing on sites in high-risk regions. This training, reaching approximately 63,500 workers, introduced the concepts of workplace rights such as fair working conditions, safety, and the right to have a voice. Each of the topics further elaborated on the basic rights of workers according to HP's Supplier Code of Conduct, including exercising their rights using various available channels at supplier sites, HP's grievance mechanism channels, and independent external feedback mechanisms to seek help.

- Supplier Code of Conduct: We delivered training to supply chain and global infrastructure partners, reaching 18,900 workers. The training is designed to ensure that workers understand their rights and manage their responsibilities to respect human rights, including identifying the necessary management systems that should be in place. Additionally, if a supplier's work makes them more prone to experience certain risks, we assign them specific modules that address the RBA Code of Conduct in order to increase their awareness of the specific risk. For instance, suppliers that are more prone to health and safety risks are assigned the RBA Health &amp; Safety Training module to improve their health and safety practices.

- Responsible Minerals: We held two virtual training sessions on responsible minerals, one in English and the other in Chinese, attended by more than 210 participants, including supplier representatives and members of the HP Supplier Management team.

- Responsible Recruitment: We developed a worker-centric training on responsible recruitment that helps workers identify their classification (e.g., foreign migrant worker, dispatched worker, or student worker) and associated risks. The intended outcome of this training is to educate these individuals to better protect themselves and exercise their rights, including freely chosen employment, prohibition of recruitment fees, and confidential complaints. This training was delivered to 37,200 value chain workers (including sub-tier suppliers) and offered information about HP's grievance mechanism channels.
