# The Pursuit of Net-Zero Emissions

As part of our overall sustainability plan, HP is reducing GHG emissions across our value chain, enhancing circularity of our products and packaging, and investing in forest restoration and sustainable management. We aim to achieve business growth while lowering emissions and minimizing resource use through innovative solutions, forward-thinking product design, and transformative business models.

To support our near-term goal of a 50% reduction by 2030, and our ultimate goal of reaching net zero by 2040, we have established intermediate objectives to guide our progress toward net zero, including:

- Reaching 100% renewable electricity in our operations.
- Using 30% postconsumer recycled content plastic across HP's personal systems and print product portfolios.
- Reaching 75% circularity for products and packaging.

# Achieving Net-Zero Emissions

HP recognizes that achieving net-zero emissions requires a comprehensive approach that includes reducing emissions across our value chain and addressing any residual emissions that cannot be eliminated. To this end, we plan to leverage high-quality carbon credits as part of our strategy to offset these unavoidable emissions.
