# Audit and Assessment Results

In 2024, we completed 374 audits of production suppliers, product reuse and recycling vendors, and nonproduction suppliers, as well as 34 other assessments of production suppliers. During the year, 86% of production supplier audits were third-party certified RBA VAP audits.

Our audits reveal a wide range of maturity levels among suppliers, assessed on a scale of 0-200. Under the RBA VAP Program, suppliers scoring between 160 and 180 are eligible for Silver certification, while those scoring above 180 quality for Gold certification. In 2024, 34% of audited suppliers' facilities scored between 160 to 180. Another 34% scored above 180, making them eligible for Silver and Gold certifications respectively.

# Supply Chain

During 2024, we completed 291 supplier audits. For most of our production suppliers, we conduct full audits against our SCoC. For nonproduction and product transportation suppliers, our audits may only cover SCoC sections relevant to their operations.

# HP Operations

In 2024, with certified auditors, we conducted 83 audits and assessments covering labor rights at HP-owned sites, including offices, manufacturing locations, and non-manufacturing operations. HP sites are required to complete an annual SAQ to identify any risks. In addition, our manufacturing operations undergo RBA VAP audits every two years.

* Audits of production suppliers and suppliers supporting HP manufacturing followed the RBA Code of Conduct (either 70.1, 71.1, 71.2, 71.3 or 8.0) audit protocols. We contract with Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to audit product reuse and recycling vendors for conformance with the following policies and vendor standards: Export of Electronic Waste to Developing Countries Policy, HP Supplier Code of Conduct, and HP reuse and recycling standards. See Repair, Reuse, and Recycle for details. Audits of nonproduction suppliers supporting HP offices, off-site third-party nonproduction suppliers, and HP offices were focused on labor, ethics, and management systems.
