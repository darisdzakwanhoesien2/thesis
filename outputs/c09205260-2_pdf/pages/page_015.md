|  Environmental  |   |   |   |   |   |
|  Sustainable products and services and circular economy | Circular economy | Supply chain | Managing product lifecycles through design and business models emphasizing serviceability, longevity, repair, reuse, recycling, recycled content, and closed material loops, aiming to reduce waste and foster a circular economy. | Materials | Circularity  |
|   |   |  HP operations |   | Waste  |   |
|   |   |  Products and solutions |   | Supplier Environmental Assessment  |   |
|  Climate change | Supply chain GHG emissions | Supply chain | Collaborating across our value chain and with external partners to address climate change by reducing operational, product use, and supply chain GHG emissions. This holistic approach contributes to mitigating the impacts of climate change on our business, customers, the environment, and society. | Energy | Carbon  |
|   |  Operational GHG emissions | HP operations |   | Emissions  |   |
|   |  Product use GHG emissions | Products and solutions |   | Economic Performance  |   |
|   |  Physical risks  |   |   |   |   |
|   |  Transition risks  |   |   |   |   |
|  Materials and substances of concern | Substances of concern | Supply chain (upstream) | Addressing the responsible management of substances of concern, including adopting practices that prioritize environmental and social considerations, safeguarding against potential harm, and fostering more sustainable material usage throughout our operations. This approach includes preventing ecosystem disruption and ensuring ethical raw material sourcing. | Biodiversity | Circularity  |
|   |  Ecosystem disruption | HP operations |   | Materials | Human rights due diligence  |
|   |  Ethical raw material sourcing | Products and solutions |   |   | Responsible minerals program  |
|   |   |   |   |   |  Forests  |
|  Waste | Disposal of e-waste | Supply chain | Addressing waste challenges, such as promoting responsible disposal of electronic waste, packaging, and manufacturing waste throughout the value chain. Emphasizing reduction and recycling to address environmental pollution and reducing risk to soil and water resources from potential contamination and hazards. | Materials | Circularity  |
|   |  Disposal of packaging waste | HP operations |   | Waste | Waste  |
|   |  Disposal of manufacturing waste  |   |   |   |   |
|   |  Value chain waste generation  |   |   |   |   |
|  Water | Water consumption | Supply chain (upstream) | Reducing water consumption and addressing pollution and water scarcity concerns in affected regions. This approach includes monitoring the quality of discharge emissions to water at sites where monitoring is required based on local permits. HPs initiatives prioritize sustainable practices, emphasizing responsible water usage to safeguard communities and reduce environmental impact. | Water and Effluents | Water  |
