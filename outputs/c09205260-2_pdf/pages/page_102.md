# Additional Programs and Activities

To support identification of human rights risks, HP carried out additional specific activities in 2024:

## Enterprise Risk Management

HP operates a comprehensive and robust Enterprise Risk Management program, involving a thorough process of identifying and managing critical enterprise risks by surveying and interviewing senior leaders. The program incorporates best practice analysis and external expertise, which adds a layer of rigor and credibility to the risk assessment process. Sustainability and human rights questions are part of the risk assessment and are analyzed in our program, as they align with broader corporate responsibility goals.

## Risk Assessment Platform: Suppliers' Risk Analysis

We utilize a risk-based approach to our HRDD and analyze our suppliers using a data-driven supply chain environmental and societal due diligence platform. This Risk Assessment Platform helps us to identify new and emerging supply chain risks by geography (both region and country); sector; product; and topics such as labor (including forced and child labor, wages and working hours, and discrimination), health and safety, environment, business ethics, and management systems.

To identify, analyze, and predict the risks, the program uses machine learning combined with on-site data generated from multiple sources, including worker viewpoints collected through grievance mechanisms and worker surveys, audits, NGOs, international organizations, and data collected from vendors and sites. Data analytics are utilized to create predictive models to assess the likelihood of risks such as unauthorized subcontracting, human trafficking, and labor unrest. The program helps us design and implement due diligence solutions that are risk-based, strategic,

and tailored to the unique context, ambitions, and supply chain characteristics of HP.

The Responsible Sourcing team uses the platform in conjunction with risk and impact assessments and other programs to identify human rights risks, including the following risk factors:

- Procurement Categories: Higher risk procurement categories are determined by the type of activity carried out by the supplier and the association with the HP brand. High-risk categories include manufacturing and assembly of parts/components, call centers, warranty/break fix, reuse/recycling, and branded merchandise.

- Supplier-Specific Factors: Supplier-specific risk factors include workforce composition, past performance, nature of business relationship with HP, and volume of business. Insight from previous audits, press articles, incidents, or accidents may also affect our assessment of supplier risk.

- External Stakeholder Reports: NGO and other external stakeholder reports highlight risks, and HP determines actions as required.

According to this tool and other human rights programs, activities, and risk factors, potential risk locations in our supply chain include Malaysia, China, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Mexico, and India. China and Malaysia have also been mentioned as high-risk countries involved in the electronics sector in the 2024 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor and Forced Labor by the US Department of Labor.

## New Supplier Initial Risk Assessment Process

In 2024, to improve our responsible procurement practices, HP introduced a new Initial Risk Assessment Process, designed to identify and mitigate any actual or potential social impact associated with a new supplier or site. The assessment takes place when onboarding a new manufacturing supplier who has no prior engagement with HP or an existing manufacturing supplier undergoing significant operational changes, such as new facilities or site locations and/or manufacturing suppliers inherited through a business acquisition.

Suppliers are required to complete a risk assessment form providing human rights information about their operations and supply chain. If a supplier does not meet HP's human rights requirements, they are required to improve the gaps prior to HP onboarding. This process ensures early detection and risk mitigation before suppliers enter our supply chain.
