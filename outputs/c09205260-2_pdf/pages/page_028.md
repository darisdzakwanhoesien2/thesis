# Products

From beginning to end, our products are designed with circularity in mind.

## Personal Systems

HP's personal systems include commercial and consumer desktop and notebook personal computers, workstations, and displays. We design these systems with durability in mind and test them against the MIL-STD-810, $^{41}$ a US Department of Defense standard for testing the reliability and durability of military equipment. These steps ensure the longevity of our personal systems and reduce the chance that these products will need frequent replacement. In 2024, HP published the third-party test results of our Business PCs against MIL-STD-810, in which every system passed. $^{44}$

During the design phase, HP completes a Serviceability Scorecard for PCs and Displays to determine how easy the product is to repair. New designs are scored across six categories, including fastener reusability, customer serviceability and replaceability, ease of disassembly, tool and screw requirements, service qualification, and skills needed to perform a service. This scoring informs circular design decisions through improvements like using non-soldered components and enabling battery replacement.

To extend the life of our personal computers (PCs), HP offers reliable refurbished devices that come with a one-year limited warranty, with an option to extend support for up to three years.

## Printing Solutions

Our printing solutions cover equipment and supplies for home, office, large-format, and 3D printing, as well as commercial and industrial presses. Through modular design, we increase upgradeability $^{41}$ and enable many of our printers to be disassembled easily for repair or recycling.

HP Certified Refurbished Hardware offers performance-tested devices that meet HP's high quality standards. $^{44}$ Each product is carefully refurbished using only HP Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts and is backed by global service support, $^{44}$ delivering reliable performance while helping organizations meet sustainability goals. By choosing certified refurbished hardware, customers can reduce their environmental impact and maximize their technology investment—without compromising quality.

## Energy Efficient, More Circular Print Cartridges

Original HP Toner Cartridges with new, innovative TerraJet technology are up to $30\%$ smaller, $^{50}$ use up to $35\%$ recycled plastic content, $^{51}$ and reduce energy consumption by up to $27\%$, $^{52}$ all while increasing print speeds and producing even more vibrant colors and images.

EvoCycle cartridges include a minimum of $45\%$ reused or recycled components by absolute weight. $^{53}$ This innovative process enables EvoCycle cartridges to have a $37\%$ lower carbon footprint than standard Original HP Toner Cartridges, $^{54}$ while supporting the circular economy by using less virgin plastic.

## Large Format Printing

In 2024, HP released the newest versions of our DesignJet T200 and T600 large format plotter series, both designed with a minimum of $40\%$ postconsumer recycled plastic $^{55}$ —a $10\%$ increase in recycled plastic over previous models. Maintenance cartridges for our Latex 630, 700, and 800 large format printers are designed with at least $45\%$ postconsumer recycled plastic. Additionally, HP's circular design approach enabled our V87XL replacement smart tank ink bottles, used with our HP Designjet Smart tank T800 &amp; T900 large format plotters, to increase from $0\%$ to $45\%$ postconsumer recycled plastic.

HP Latex inks are made in a factory that uses reclaimed water. In this way, HP contributes to water resiliency and protecting natural resources. The water HP uses has gone through multiple purification steps, providing a purity that is comparable or higher than conventional tap water—as confirmed by regular monitoring—and ensures

that we provide our customers with inks that deliver the outstanding performance they have come to expect from HP.

## Industrial Print

HP designs our industrial digital printing presses for longevity, and for individual components to be replaced and upgraded to improve performance and functionality over time. We also design these systems to be easily upgraded, repaired, and refurbished. HP's Indigo Certified Pre-Owned program was created to extend the life of our commercial presses, keeping them out of landfills while providing high-quality systems at lower price points. In 2024, $12\%$ of all industrial presses delivered were certified pre-owned through this program.

HP is committed to continuing service support, upgrades, and the sale of pre-owned systems and refurbished spare parts. In 2024, HP found that $96\%$ of PageWide presses are still in use, with $93\%$ of those in operation for over a decade. $^{56}$ Among many improvements, the introduction of High Definition Nozzle Architecture and HP Brilliant Inks led to a $60\%$ increase in PageWide mono printing speed and extended the life of this product line. HP resold nine pre-owned PageWide presses in 2024.
