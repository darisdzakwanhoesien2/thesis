# Worker Agency, Well-Being, and Voice

When workers are aware of their rights and the procedures that safeguard their physical and mental health in the workplace, we can prevent harm and mitigate risks. In 2024, we continued to expand communication channels to gather worker feedback. We conducted Worker Well-Being Surveys and interviews during audits, and we collected data from grievance mechanisms to inform our human rights program.

Our Worker Well-Being Surveys help to inform our understanding of workers in our supply chain and improve our collaborations with suppliers to deliver better working environments. The survey focuses on four primary areas: (1) career progression and worker motivation, (2) worker mental and physical health, (3) general engagement levels, such as worker satisfaction, and (4) respect and communication. In 2024, the survey was conducted at three sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and China, reaching approximately 550 workers.

Suppliers in Singapore and Malaysia employ a considerable proportion of migrant workers within their workforce. Consequently, data has been disaggregated by nationality to identify specific needs, enabling local human resources teams to better understand the support, motivation, and well-being initiatives required to ensure that workers feel secure and comfortable in their workplace. A common concern of migrant workers in these countries was job security and outlook regarding career progression. As a result, HP recommended that onsite management provide more clarity in job progression or opportunities to improve workers' underlying concerns and motivate for future opportunities.

Areas of improvement for the sites related to gaps in communication regarding both anti-harassment policies and performance appraisal process.

Recommendations shared by HP to the sites included a refresh on anti-harassment training, communication on updates to the performance review process, and creating a skill matrix system to help improve workers' awareness on these topics and the confidence to exercise agency.

Based on supplier feedback, we implemented changes to training formats. In 2024, feedback addressed included changing trainings from online or mobile application to offline trainings. Though mobile application provides the ease of learning anytime and anywhere, it is difficult for factories to track individual completion of trainings. Suppliers asked for offline formats to allow greater control and flexibility through classroom and conference learning paired with lesson reviews, peer learnings, and lesson modularity.
