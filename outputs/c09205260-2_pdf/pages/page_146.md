# Our People

When it comes to HP employees, we focus on representation, career development, and fostering a culture of belonging.

## Representation

HP is at our best when we are able to attract the brightest minds from all backgrounds and groups. Our recruitment strategy is designed to help us increase representation of a broad spectrum of experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds across HP. We are expanding our hiring and creating new pathways to include nontraditional routes to employment, including removing four-year degree requirements for some roles and securing talent from apprenticeships, transitioning veterans, community colleges, people with disabilities, technical school graduates, and those returning to the workforce. See Our Communities.

We continue to prioritize creating opportunities for employees by ensuring responsible and fair practices; implementing world-class programs; and providing training, growth, and development opportunities.

We are committed to continuing to support women at HP. In 2024, HP became a signatory of the Women Empowerment Principles, reinforcing our commitment to the United Nations' seven principles in support of gender equality and women's empowerment.

## Business Resource Groups (BRGs)

HP's BRGs are employee-led communities that champion inclusion, foster belonging, and bring HP's global inclusion strategy to life. Open to all employees, BRGs lead community outreach programs, support inclusive talent development, and help drive local hiring, career growth, and mentoring. They also organize campaigns that celebrate identity and belonging across HP.

In 2024, HP supported 141 BRGs across 39 countries, representing a wide range of communities—including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Black/African Americans, Hispanic/Latino communities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ employees, veterans, women, and multicultural and multigenerational groups. Each BRG operates with a global-local model and is supported by dedicated leadership roles such as Global Chairs, Co-Chairs, and Communications and Finance Officers.

HP's BRGs are not only vital to employee engagement, they also contribute to business innovation and social impact. In recognition of these efforts, HP's Hispanic/Latino BRG received the BRG of the Year Award from the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) in 2024, honoring its leadership in STEM outreach, inclusive hiring, and community engagement.
