# Industry Collaboration and Stakeholder Engagement

HP has made significant progress through our top-down approach of assessing our supply chain at the smelter and refiner level—the critical "pinch point" for monitoring responsible sourcing. HP is committed to further addressing salient human rights risks beyond the pinch point and at the source via industry collaboration and a bottom-up approach. Industry collaboration is vital to drive long-term, systemic changes across the supply chain by creating a unified approach toward mitigating human rights risks. HP's industry engagement at a grassroots level not only prevents potential violations by fostering better working conditions, but it also mitigates risks by implementing systems for continuous improvement to uphold human rights and promote positive social and environmental outcomes.

- Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI): HP is a long-standing member of the RMI, one of the most respected and widely used resources for companies seeking to improve mineral sourcing practices, enhance regulatory compliance aligned with international standards, and support industry and stakeholder expectations. In 2024, HP was appointed to the RMI Steering Committee, where we support the strategic direction of RMI's programs. HP also proactively engages in several of RMI's working groups, such as the Due Diligence Practice team and the Emerging Minerals team, and we co-lead the China Smelter Engagement team. By participating in these and other working groups, HP supports industry change by collaborating with peers and stakeholders, engages with certain 3TG and critical mineral facilities directly, and aids the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) program.

- Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA): In 2024, we joined IRMA to enable HP to engage with the mining sector beyond the smelter and refiner pinch point. Through IRMA, HP supports independent assessment of social and environmental performance at large-scale mining (LSM) sites. IRMA's internationally recognized standard, developed in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, provides publicly available audit results that offer credible information to companies and civil society alike. Participation in IRMA allows us to stay connected to upstream supply chain activities, helping advocate for transparency and continuous improvement.

- Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM): The artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector, which provides livelihoods for over 40 million people in developing regions that face significant social and environmental challenges, is another important sector with high human rights risks. ARM, a global NGO based in Colombia, empowers ASM communities by promoting social and environmental standards, fostering formalization, and integrating ASM into more responsible supply chains. HP partners with ARM to support the responsible production of gold, the most common mineral mined by ASM and a material used in HP's products via the Fairmined Gold Credit system. This innovative system enables HP to support small-scale mines certified under the Fairmined standard, which ensures compliance with strict social and environmental criteria. Given the continuous investments needed to achieve responsible mining, Fairmined Credits provide a financial incentive to improve standards, ultimately promoting human rights, community development, and the empowerment of vulnerable populations, including women and children. In 2024, HP launched a pilot project, purchasing Fairmined Credits for the equivalent of 4.25kg of certified gold from mines in

Colombia and Peru, to support improving lives for children and women rights in mining sites' communities.

- European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM): HP is an active member of the EPRM, a multi-stakeholder initiative aimed at increasing the supply of responsibly sourced minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). EPRM funds pilot projects that have a direct, positive impact on the ground, helping improve conditions for mining communities and reduce human rights risks in these regions. In 2023, the EPRM expanded the mineral scope of its Request for Proposals (RFPs) to include lithium, cobalt, copper, natural graphite, and nickel, reflecting an increased focus on minerals relevant for the energy transition. During 2024, HP proactively engaged with EPRM's efforts, chairing the Advisory Committee during the RFP period. In this role, HP helped shape the direction of EPRM's work by providing critical feedback on the evaluation of project proposals.
