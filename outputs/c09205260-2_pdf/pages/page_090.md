# Anti-Corruption

## Corruption disrupts fair competition and is at odds with HP values. We do not tolerate corrupt practices of any kind, including bribery and kickbacks.

Our Anti-Corruption Policy and compliance program require our employees, partners, and suppliers to follow all applicable national laws and regulations, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. All of our operational sites and subsidiaries are required to follow HP's Anti-Corruption Policy and are subject to HP's compliance program and procedures (or a comparable subsidiary-level policy and compliance program).

## Risk Assessment and Audits

HP conducts regular internal assessments of corruption-related risks on a cross-section of our global operations. Assessments are based on perceived risk, including detailed reviews of the company's global policies and processes applicable to all business units and global functions worldwide. We also use internal data and Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) to identify high-risk regions and assess risks related to our business. To monitor and mitigate potential risk from our public sector business, we maintain a public sector data analytics process. Detailed statistical analyses enhance our ability to identify potential corruption risk.

We also periodically retain external experts to assess our anti-corruption policies and programs. We benchmark our approach against peer companies to identify best practices in areas including operational procedures, employee education, and supplier and partner training and monitoring. Complementing these assessments, HP conducts regular audits focused on potential corruption risks in our operations. These audits include end-to-end review and testing of compliance policies and processes.

Potential corruption risks are reviewed using HP transactional data and third-party corruption assessments. The Anti-Corruption team may then take various actions to appropriately minimize or eliminate identified risk such as termination of partner contracts or special handling measures.

## Third-Party Management and Due Diligence

HP takes a risk-based approach to due diligence of third parties that support our business, including channel partners, sales intermediaries, suppliers, and lobbyists. In general, all high-risk third parties must successfully pass HP's due diligence process before beginning a contractual relationship.

We determine risk levels based primarily on completion of our due diligence questionnaire by the third party (every three years for existing partners and high-risk suppliers), as well as the country-level Consumer Price Index (CPI). Factors considered include political, geographical, and industry-based risks; making use of a wide range of structured and unstructured databases; and machine learning and cognitive computing capabilities to identify and manage potential areas of concern. Based on this information, we decide whether to conduct an additional due diligence investigation. If we determine that the risk cannot be mitigated, we apply consequences to the relevant third party by removing access to specific benefits and/or terminating any contract with HP.

Third parties also receive training as part of our due diligence process, and we communicate our anti-corruption standards and requirements through contractual terms and conditions, as well as through our Partner Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct.

## Training and Communication

We deliver comprehensive anti-corruption content to all employees and members of the Board of Directors through annual Integrity at HP training. As part of this training, employees in sales, finance, government relations, partner-facing, and public sector roles are assigned additional anti-corruption content. Employees in high-risk roles who interact with the US public sector must also complete additional targeted training on ethical business practices and requirements for conducting business with the US government. We communicate year-round with employees to reinforce our policies, controls, and training.

In 2024, we continued our targeted, risk-based anti-corruption site visits. Employees at facilities in Hungary, Indonesia, Poland, and Saudi Arabia received in-person training from members of the Anti-Corruption team. Sites were selected based on anti-corruption risk and HP business priorities, with content customized to take local laws, trends, and business processes into account.

When it comes to mitigating anti-corruption risk associated with charitable giving, requirements are communicated to employees through the HP Global Charitable Contributions Policy, and risks are mitigated through the grant-making process.
