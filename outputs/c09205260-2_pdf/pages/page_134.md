# Health and Wellness

Although digital innovation is changing the face of healthcare, there remains a stark digital divide; many patients living in rural, socioeconomically challenged, or marginalized communities lack the technology and connectivity required to engage in their own care. HP Healthcare provides solutions

to the challenges facing clinicians, care teams, patients, and healthcare facilities. Through patient-first, personalized care, we support solutions that address barriers, including access to devices, software, and the digital skills needed to use these tools effectively.
