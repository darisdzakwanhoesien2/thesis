## To determine the content included in this report, we considered:

- Recognized standards, frameworks, and global sustainability context, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Global Compact and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability Disclosure Standards.
- Engagement with a range of stakeholders including employees, investors, suppliers, customers, peer companies, public policymakers, industry bodies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and sector experts.
- Sustainability material topics from our latest sustainability materiality assessment, conducted in early 2024.

## Report Scope:

Published in August 2025, the 2024 HP Sustainable Impact Report details our Sustainable Impact strategy, targets, and progress. HP assumes no obligation to update this report after its publication. Unless otherwise noted, report content:

- Includes HP's headquarters and 100% of HP's global business operations and/or revenue–except Apogee, Simpress, and CyberCore, independent subsidiaries of HP–unless otherwise stated.
- Encompasses Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 (1 November 2023 through 31 October 2024).
- Reflects data for the year ending 31 October 2024.

## Additional Notes on Report Data and Metrics:

- Years mentioned refer to HP's FY, unless otherwise noted.
- Relevant endnotes in Highlights section can be found in corresponding sections throughout the report.
- Collecting data from more than 100 sites globally and from our supply chain is complex, and the process can vary by issue, business unit, function, and geography. As a result, company-wide metrics can be challenging to define and implement. We continue to standardize our measurement systems and metrics.
- Most metrics in the report have been rounded to aid readability. In some cases, segments do not add up to the total due to rounding.
- Assumptions are utilized when estimating Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, product energy consumption and resulting GHG emissions, the percentage of HP products that are recycled, and other metrics. Where appropriate, we provide context for data to help readers understand limitations and draw appropriate conclusions.
- To provide comparative information, HP reports historical data from the previous year or the baseline year. Adjusting comparative information for one or more prior periods to achieve comparability with the current period can be impracticable in certain cases. If comparative information cannot be provided, it is indicated to help readers understand the limitation.

- Circumstances exist in which data cannot be collected on time due to various reasons. Report data may contain estimates in order to report complete and representative numbers. HP provides the most accurate data based on the information available.
- After the report publication, new data may become available. Such data are beyond the scope of this report, which represents HP's best understanding of its data at the time of publication.
- Forward-looking statements reflect approaches, goals, and priorities established by HP. This content was set in consultation with internal–and in some cases external–stakeholders, and considers leading corporate practices.
