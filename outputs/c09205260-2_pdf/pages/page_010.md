Sustainable

Impact Report

Our Executive Leadership team, led by HP's chief executive officer, retains overall responsibility for Sustainable Impact as part of our business strategy. Members of the Executive Leadership team, including the chief enterprise operations officer, business division presidents, chief marketing and corporate affairs officer, oversee Sustainable Impact targets relevant to their organizations. Performance against these and other business objectives is considered in total compensation.

The HP Board of Directors' Nominating, Governance, and Social Responsibility Committee (NGSRC) oversees, periodically reviews, and, as appropriate, makes recommendations to the board on the strategic priorities and investments related to sustainability and social impact. Convening at least four times each year, the NGSRC receives regular updates on Sustainable Impact strategy, results, and key risks and opportunities, including policies, positions, and goals relating to global citizenship, sustainability, climate change, human rights, and digital equity.

The NGSRC is also briefed on the impact of HP's operations on employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and communities worldwide; supply chain, environment, and sustainability performance; and HP's annual Sustainable Impact Report. As needed, the NGSRC makes recommendations to HPs Board of Directors, the majority of which have experience in environmental and social responsibility issues.

Performance of our chief enterprise operations officer, chief sustainability officer, and senior vice president of Global Product Compliance &amp; Sustainable Impact (GPC &amp; SI) is also evaluated in part based on the management of Sustainable Impact and the achievement of related targets and metrics. These evaluations impact compensation. Corporate initiatives to address Empowering Customer Sustainability, Transforming HP's Value Chain, and Advancing Societal Impact may be considered as a component of other company executives' total compensation as well.

Composed of domain expert representatives from across our organization, the Sustainable Impact Steering Committee manages and helps drive progress toward our goals. Additionally, every employee is encouraged to consider our Sustainable Impact strategy as part of their annual goal-setting process.
