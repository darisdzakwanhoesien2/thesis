# Human Rights Impact Assessments

Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) are specialized, in-depth forms of HRDD that aim to identify actual and potential human rights impacts on workers and communities in a defined geographic area. They are an invaluable tool to understand the lived experience of vulnerable stakeholders and the ways to improve HRDD based on the perspectives of rights-holders.

In 2024, we conducted one HRIA for HP's suppliers and sub-tier in Thailand, plus started another in Mexico. These locations and suppliers were selected to obtain a more comprehensive view of human rights risks across different parts of HP's value chain, including in high risk, advanced supplier operations. Conducted over the course of several months, the HRIAs involved immersion in HP's operations and value chain to understand the production processes and oversight structure. This step was followed by a preliminary risk analysis that mapped the most salient human rights risks by country and sector based on desk research and expert engagement.

We conduct extensive stakeholder engagement during every HRIA, with advisors conducting site visits to multiple supplier sites in each country. For the HRIA in Thailand, external advisors visited five supplier sites, interviewing both key management personnel and approximately 70 factory workers on site. The advisors also conducted an expert stakeholder engagement process, including interviews with local and international civil society organizations about key challenges to human rights in the country.

When safely possible, the advisors engage with human rights defenders. Human rights defenders have unique insights and perspectives on the potential human rights impacts and opportunities of business activities by working directly with communities that are most likely to be affected by business operations. Lastly, the experts engage with HP and supplier management, and they review existing risk management protocols to develop practical recommendations tailored to address the most salient human rights risks.
