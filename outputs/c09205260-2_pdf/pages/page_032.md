# Renewable Materials

HP focuses on sourcing renewable materials in the interest of protecting ecosystems and resources for future generations.

We strive to ensure that our paper and fiber-based packaging are derived from recycled or renewable content and to counteract deforestation related to non-HP paper used by our printing products and print services. See the Forests section.

In addition, we continually explore the use of other renewable materials for products and packaging. For example, we have used plastics in our products that incorporate bio-feedstocks in place of fossil fuels. These materials are evaluated against HP's sustainability criteria, which includes reviewing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data to fully understand their environmental and social impacts and confirming that they are less impactful than the materials being replaced. Bio-feedstocks considered for use in products or packaging must be legal, renewable, and sustainably grown—without impacting regional food security, land use practices, or key ecosystems—as verified through a credible certification standard. Also, the use of bio-feedstocks must not impact the recyclability of plastic resins, so they can continue to cycle through the economy.

# Portfolio Highlights in 2024

We continue to develop products with reduced environmental impact by incorporating increasing amounts of recycled and renewable content. References for this section can be found in Endnotes under Materials.
