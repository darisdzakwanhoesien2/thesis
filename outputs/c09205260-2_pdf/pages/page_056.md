Removing barriers that otherwise prohibit people with disabilities from engaging as dignified, independent, equal, and active members of our communities is critical for society and business to thrive. We are investing in accelerating digital equity for 150 million people by 2030,⁶⁷ including individuals with disabilities, through the Digital Equity Accelerator and other initiatives.

## Embedding Accessibility into Product Design

Accessibility is fundamental to inclusive design, ensuring ease of use, choice of interaction, and productivity for everyone, not just as an add-on for select individuals. The HP Hardware Accessibility Testing Guide details how we test products and services for accessibility and transparently communicate the results in our conformance reports. We voluntarily share this information to help advance a broader industry conversation about best testing practices in support of more accessible products.

We welcome opportunities to incorporate feedback from the global disability community into our accessibility program. For example, our dedicated Accessibility Customer Support team provides technical support assistance for people with disabilities or age-related limitations in North America, including through a contact form. See our Product Accessibility website for more details.
