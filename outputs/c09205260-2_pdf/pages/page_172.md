2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Sustainable Impact

1. Reported in accordance with Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy (cS3). HP included revenue from products certified to eco labels (EPEAT® Gold/Silver, TCO, Blue Anger, and ENERGY STAR®), products designed using recycled materials, products that have been recycled, fixed, or resold, and products as a service with end-of-life management policies.

2. Percentage of HP's total annual product and packaging content, by weight, that comes from recycled and renewable materials and reused products and parts. 2024 data do not include the following products or packaging for these products: some personal systems accessories and print accessories sold separately.

3. Recycled content plastic as a percentage of total plastic used in all HP personal systems, printer hardware, and print cartridges shipped during the reporting year. Total volume excludes brand licensed products and after-market hardware accessories. Total recycled content plastic includes postconsumer recycled plastic, closed-loop plastic, and ocean-bound plastics used in HP products. Personal systems plastic is defined by EPEAT® eco-label criteria. Subject to relevant restrictions on the use and distribution of materials destined for recycling and/or recycled feedstocks.

4. Calculated as the percentage of primary plastic packaging (by weight, reduced per unit shipped, Excludes secondary and tertiary packaging components. Includes HP personal systems and printer software packaging. Does not include packaging for the following: Graphics Solutions hardware other than PageWide XL and DesignJet printers; 3D printing hardware; print supplies; refurbished products; and accessories such as third-party options, drop in box, and aftermarket options.

5. Zero-waste operations: Achieve 90% landfill diversion for non-hazardous solid waste across direct operations. The diversion methods include reuse, recycling, composting, and incineration (waste to energy recovery) solutions. Includes all HP owned and managed sites worldwide.

6. Recycled plastic is expressed as a percentage of the total weight plastic. Postconsumer recycled content is based on the definition set in the EPEAT standard for imaging equipment, IEEE 1680.2.

7. Incorporation of a minimum of 5% of recycled metal, expected to be implemented in units manufactured after 1 April 2024. Recycled metal is expressed as a percentage of the total weight of the metal according to ISO 14021 definitions. This number is the minimum and may vary slightly due to manufacturing processes and material availability.

8. The HP DesignJet T200/1500 2025 Edition plotter series use EPS-free packaging with molded pulp cushions made from recycled fiber-based material. The plastic reduction is expressed as a percentage of the total packaging plastic weight. The reduction varies depending on the printer model, with at least a 53% reduction in the new 36 inch model and at least a 12% reduction in the new 24 inch model, compared with the previous T200/1600 models.

9. The percentage reductions in energy consumption are based on tests conducted by HP in 2024. Data based on the implementation of auto-scheduled and off usage in various printer models, measured on a monthly basis. Actual savings may vary depending on the specific usage patterns, printer models, and environmental conditions.

10. UL ECOLOGY Certified HP 712 inks meet a range of stringent human health and environmental considerations. For certifications, see: http://www.ul.com/EL and http://www.ul.com/gg.

13. Recycled plastic is expressed as a percentage of the total weight plastic. Postconsumer recycled content is based on the definition set in the EPEAT standard for imaging equipment, IEEE 1680.2.

14. HP 68s Cushions for Cartridges have a lower carbon footprint compared with standard HP 68 Original ink Cartridges when normalized to print 1/200 pages. Based on LCA study conforming to ISO 14043/44 and third-party verified. See Cushions LCA report.

15. HP 68s Cushions Original Ink Cartridges compared with HP 68 standard Original ink Cartridges. Page solid tested in HP Envy 6501x Alco-Cine printer. Average continuous printing size (c/block and composite) (raw) (migrants/yellow) based on 50 DEC 24711 or HP leading methodology. Actual yield varies considerably based on content of printed pages and other factors. For details, see hp.com/gulwormdouduuppies.
