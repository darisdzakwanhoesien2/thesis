2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Responsible Recruitment

HP recognizes the importance of responsible recruitment and is committed to the Employer Pays Principle, which means that our workers will not pay fees to obtain a job. All workers—foreign migrant workers in particular—face heightened forced labor risks during the recruitment process due to challenges such as long-distance travel, separation from family and home, language barriers, and living and working in an unfamiliar environment. HP is dedicated to addressing these issues and promoting responsible recruitment practices across our operations and supply chain. This commitment is included in our Human Rights Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, and Foreign Migrant Worker Standard, which also require that suppliers specify in their contract with recruitment agents the prohibition of charging fees to foreign migrant workers.

Additionally, in 2024, HP partnered with Embode, a leading consulting company, to further advance responsible recruitment practices with selected suppliers through their Ganapati Initiative. This initiative's systematic and collaborative approach strengthens suppliers' capabilities for responsible recruitment and labor best practices over a 12-month period. Each supplier is assessed on their own strengths and challenges, and a collaborative action plan is designed, tailored to each supplier's needs. The consultant provides ongoing support to implement the action plan, which may include targeted training, advisory consultations, and practical guidance on integrating responsible recruitment practices internally.

We are also members of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment and collaborate with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a multi-industry organization focused on responsible business conduct in global supply chains, providing more effective and timely remedy and engagement with affected parties and reducing the risk of forced labor in recruitment and employment. HP is informed by RBA's practices and tools on responsible recruitment, such as the Responsible Recruitment Program, the RBA Practical Guide to Due Diligence on Recruitment Fees, and the RBA Migration Corridor Database, which uses a third party to annually update average fees paid by workers in the most common recruitment corridors. In collaboration with peer companies and RBA, in 2024, we delivered training that included a deep dive into responsible recruitment practices. Learn more about this and other trainings delivered through industry collaboration.

# MillionMakers

MillionMakers is an HRDD platform using direct worker voice developed by Bluenumber, Be Slavery Free, Unseen UK, and The Mekong Club. Since 2022, HP has used MillionMakers to help us enhance our HRDD program and identify and address issues raised by workers across two of the identified potential risk locations in our supply chain: Malaysia and India. Over 2,000 workers have shared their feedback, providing us with an alternative perspective of risk assessment through direct worker voice.

Workers are best positioned to help us identify forced labor and worker rights abuses. By simply scanning a QR code, they can opt in and respond to yes/no questions over five days, always remaining anonymous and without collection of personal data. Their responses are measured against the International Labor Organization (ILO) Forced Labour Indicators on working conditions. Importantly, workers have data rights and own what they create; they are paid on their dataset license if they consent to share it. MillionMakers creates risk reports both for specific sites and in aggregate for our value chains, using the Bluenumber digital identity technology to authenticate each worker and verify their data.

MillionMakers protects worker privacy and builds trust for transparency without fear of retaliation. Responses are anonymized and aggregated into a dashboard of worker sentiment against each ILO indicator so that HP sees where workers think risks exist. When results are aggregated across regions or by cluster in HP's supply chain, we use MillionMakers to inform cost-effective action plans for rapid remedy with our suppliers.

One of the sites that participated in the program showed overall good results with minimal gaps, which is an assurance to the audit report. However, when analyzing the data through a gender lens, we identified that although the general results showed no major concerns, additional action could be taken to support workplace harassment communications. Findings and recommendations were shared with the supplier. Learn about MillionMakers Implementation Plan, released in 2024, to address identified concerns through the survey.
