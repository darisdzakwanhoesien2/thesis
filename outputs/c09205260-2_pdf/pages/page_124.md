2024 Sustainable Impact Report

# Communicating Commitments

We communicate our human rights commitments and due diligence process in different forms, including in our public reporting, policies, direct engagements and consultations, and multi-stakeholder roundtables and collaborations.

In addition to this report, we disclose information about our supply chain responsibility and human rights performance through our annual US SEC Conflict Minerals Report, Modern Slavery Transparency Statement, and other human rights-related voluntary disclosures. We also provide tailored supply chain responsibility information to our customers and channel partners to help them achieve their sustainability and human rights goals.

HP engages with internal and external stakeholders on human rights topics through the following channels:

- Executive management and leadership updates, including through the Human Rights Council
- Our website
- Social media posts
- Corporate statements and disclosures
- Public speaking events
- Mandatory employee training on subjects such as privacy and integrity
- Employee resources such as human rights websites, training, and tools
- Worker voice and well-being surveys (both for our own employees and for workers in our supply chain)
- Supplier portal (enabling supplier access to HP policies, the Supplier Code of Conduct, and other relevant information)
