# Public Policy

Governments worldwide are enacting policy measures to encourage supply chain resilience, adopt responsible and ethical AI, enhance sustainability measures, strengthen cybersecurity frameworks, and promote workforce upskilling. HP seeks to partner with governments on these issues to contribute positively to communities around the world.

HP public policy advocacy engagements are aligned with our business interests. We advocate for measures that create business opportunities, allow operational flexibility, reduce risk, and align with HP's Sustainable Impact priorities.

## Policy Priorities

Our global Government Affairs and Public Policy team leads our engagement with policymakers, regulators, trade associations, and peer companies to advance public policies aligned with HP's interests and priorities.

Our priorities include:

- Ensuring fair market access and supporting supply chain resilience.
- Preserving competitive tax structures and economic investment incentives.
- Encouraging robust and interoperable AI governance frameworks that promote responsible use.
- Advancing policies that align skills with jobs.
- Increasing opportunities to expand digital equity.
- Promoting sound sustainability policies that support circular economy practices.

## Political Engagement

We conduct all political engagements in a transparent, legal, and ethical manner and in accordance with Integrity at HP.

In 2021, HP and the HP Employee Political Action Committee (PAC) ceased supporting candidates for elected office and the HP PAC was dissolved. HP does not make political contributions either within or outside the US.

We also make public our lobbying expenditures and membership in US trade associations. HP files quarterly reports as required by US law, available at the Clerk of the House website. For the EU, HP files annual reports with the Transparency Register. HP did not make any in-kind donations in 2024.

In 2024, for the seventh year in a row, we earned a perfect score and tied for first place overall among Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) 500 companies in the Center for Political Accountability (CPA) Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability.
