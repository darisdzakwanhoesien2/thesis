Impact Report

The HP supply chain security group works to ensure that our products can resist attacks throughout the entire supply chain life cycle. Our HP Product Cybersecurity Standard for Suppliers, enforced through periodic audits, contractually holds relevant suppliers to requirements that mitigate the risks of counterfeits, malware, and tampering. Further, HP continues to innovate with product design and technical capabilities to help address supply chain cybersecurity risks. The HP Platform Certificate—a secure, cryptographic platform certificate—validates system and component integrity, improving our customers' cybersecurity supply chain risk management by protecting them from malicious components and inauthentic parts. This platform certificate complies with existing Trusted Computing Group standards and will be updated accordingly to meet evolving requirements.

Since 2021, HP has maintained the ISO/IEC 20243 Supply Chain Security certification for its enterprise printers and Original HP cartridges, validating HP's commitment to deliver trusted and tamper-resistant printers and cartridges.

More information on supply chain security can be found at HP Inc. Supply Chain Security.

HP produces the world's most secure PCs and workstations. We take a unique approach, delivering comprehensive endpoint security built on a foundation of hardware-based security: a process that starts in silicon with the Endpoint Security Controller and continues with HP-developed basic input/output system (BIOS) firmware security capabilities and our ability to configure hardware security for customers—direct from the factory. This full stack enables maximum security coverage compared with a software-only approach.

HP Threat Containment solutions, such as HP Sure Click™ and HP Sure Access, expand upon traditional malware detection, providing inherent protection by isolating malware and removing risk from the most common attack types, thereby allowing users to "work without worry." HP's threat research experts also provide breaking news on malware and observed threats, including indicators of compromise and suggestions on how to defend against threats.

More information on our personal systems security solutions, including how HP Secure Erase and HP Sure Recover provide secure solutions for organizations to safely and seamlessly redeploy devices, can be found on our website. Additionally, more information on HP Renew Solutions, including HP Device Recovery Service and HP Recycling Service, can be found on the site.
