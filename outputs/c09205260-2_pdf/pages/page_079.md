# Responsible Paper Sourcing

The vendors that make up HP's supply chain play a critical role in our ability to track and improve our impact on forests. In place since 2008, HP's Sustainable Paper, Packaging, and Wood Policy is a comprehensive set of best practices and requirements for buying, selling, and using paper and wood products across the company. The policy outlines the actions our suppliers must take to do business with HP and sets the paper- and wood-based criteria against which our suppliers are evaluated.

The sustainable forests criteria requires all HP suppliers of paper, paper-based product packaging, $^{26}$ and wood used in products $^{26}$ to:

- Eliminate the use of wood and paper fiber from unwanted sources, deforested areas and converted natural ecosystems, high conservation value forests, and endangered forests. $^{27}$
- Report the source of wood and fiber paper, including compliance with legal due diligence requirements.
- Rely on international standards and widely recognized forest certifications, with preference given to Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification.
- Ensure Indigenous peoples have provided their Free and Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) for activities on their ancestral lands or lands affecting their livelihoods.

- Operate in compliance with relevant regulations and laws and apply these requirements to wood, packaging, and paper fiber procured through their suppliers, traders, brokers, distributors, auctions, and similar entities or activities.

Our suppliers are required to provide evidence of their compliance with our Sustainable Paper and Wood Policy and the related requirements in our General Specification for the Environment on an annual basis. Our paper suppliers are also required to provide fiber reports to HP, documenting the quantity of their recycled and certified content. To track compliance, an annual third-party audit is performed on HP's Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) content and our suppliers' conformance to these policies.

HP collaborates with partners to improve our responsible sourcing, including WWF's Forests Forward program and FSC, to continue delivering on HP's continued commitment to source only from responsible fiber sources. Our ongoing goal is to source 100% sustainably sourced fiber for all HP-brand paper and paper-based packaging for home and office printers and supplies, PCs, and displays, with a preference for FSC-certified fiber. Our commitment includes reviewing fiber procurement goals, risk analyses, and implementation plans, as well as engaging HP suppliers to accelerate their own responsible sourcing and nature-based solutions efforts. Through our participation in the Forest Forward program and other collaborations, we are also exploring additional ways to support FSC's efforts to increase certified forest products and increase consumer awareness.
