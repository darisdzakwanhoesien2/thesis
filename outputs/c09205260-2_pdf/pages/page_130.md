## World YMCA Partnership

Inclusive technology is vital for achieving digital equity. In partnership with YMCA, in 2024 we continued to bridge the digital divide across 14 countries, launching 320 Digital Hubs in Spain, Belgium, Moldova, the US, and beyond. Leveraging HP's cutting-edge technology and YMCA's community-based programs, we equipped young individuals and marginalized communities with the tools they need to thrive in a digital-first world, ensuring that they are prepared for the Future of Work.

These efforts have focused on enhancing access and connectivity, fostering digital skills and education, and promoting job readiness by providing essential technology, training, and resources through the launches of YMCA HP digital hubs throughout the world.

## MIT Solve

We believe AI and the convergence of universally accessible computing power with massive amounts of data and deep learning will transform the way people work and how companies operate. In partnership with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Solve, we launched the AI in Social Impact Award in 2024. The award supports entrepreneurs and their teams in advancing their AI solutions for social impact, providing each winner with US$25,000 in grant funding and an HP Z6A workstation.

Three recipients were selected in 2024: Fetosense by CareNX Innovations, which is working on an affordable AI-based heart monitoring solution designed to monitor pregnancy remotely; Livox International, a Generative AI content generation platform and alternative communication software for people with disabilities and learning impairments; and Mapeo by Awana Digital, an AI-based solution that helps Indigenous community members search for funding opportunities that will allow them to prepare documents and draft funding proposals. Ultimately, this award is intended to empower more entrepreneurs to utilize AI for social impact and amplify their efforts underway today.

## HP HOPE (HP Opportunity &amp; Equality Program)

HP HOPE program is HP's global device donation program, designed to accelerate digital equity by refurbishing end-of-use devices and redeploying them to disconnected communities. Through a unique ecosystem model that combines HP's operational capabilities, refurbishment partners, and customer participation, the program connects technology supply with social need. In FY24, HP HOPE delivered 27 projects in 12 countries, benefiting over 40,000 individuals with refurbished technology for education, economic opportunity, and the skills needed for the future of work.

## HBCU Technology Conference

In September 2024, we hosted the fourth annual Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Technology Conference. The goal of the conference was to inspire university leaders, IT professionals, faculty, staff, and students, with a focus on building diversity in the technology sector. The conference provided valuable insights on AI and its impact on higher education, especially at HBCUs. Discussions focused on the opportunities and challenges: teaching and learning solutions, best practice sharing, ethics and bias, policy, governance, and

more. The conference also discussed core IT topics, cybersecurity, and future-of-work trends. The Future of Work Academy, the student track of the conference, hosted sessions focused on building skills hiring managers seek and helping prepare students for future careers.

The conference attracted over 1,700 registrants and provided over 40 hours of content over three virtual days from 81 presenters –18 of which were HBCU faculty, staff, or leaders.
