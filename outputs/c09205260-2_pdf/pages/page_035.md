# Recycling and Zero Waste

We focus on recycling, waste diversion, and responsible waste management across our value chain. When reuse and refurbishment are not viable options, HP provides product and printing supply recycling programs to customers and audits our suppliers to ensure responsible water diversion and product disposal.

## Recycling

### Product Recycle

When HP customers are done with their products and printing supplies, we enable their recycling through our HP Planet Partners program. Our commercial customers can also responsibly dispose of and repurpose end-of-use hardware or extend the life of their existing devices through secure services and solutions offered within our Renew Solutions program, including reverse logistics and certified data sanitization.

HP provides take-back programs in 77 countries and territories worldwide $^{19}$ to make it easy for customers to turn their HP products in for potential reuse.

### Hardware and Supplies Recycling

#### 2025 GOAL

Recycle 1.2 million tonnes of hardware and supplies by 2025, since the beginning of 2016.

#### 1.1M

tonnes of hardware and supplies recycled since the beginning of 2016.

In addition, we recycle HP and non-HP hardware that cannot be economically repaired or reused across 67 countries and territories.$^{15}$ See our Hardware Recycling website for details.

In 2024, these programs enabled the recycling of 99,000 tonnes of HP hardware. Through our take-back programs, HP recycled a total volume of 110,900 tonnes of hardware and supplies, with an overall recycling rate of 17.3%.$^{16}$

### Extended Producer Responsibility

We belong to compliance systems to meet the producer responsibility requirements of the European Union (EU) Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive and end-of-life legal obligations in countries across regions in the Americas; Asia Pacific and Japan; and Europe, Middle East, and Africa.

We offer responsible processing and recycling of batteries, packaging, and HP 3D consumables in some countries in accordance with extended producer responsibility through locally approved schemes. Learn more.

To ensure compliance with WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU, we mark all EEE products with the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol and a producer identification mark. Additionally, we make available technical information—such as the disassembly instructions of our products to ease WEEE treatment and processing facilities/information—to assist treatment and recycling.
