Yes — we can build a **Streamlit OCR app using Mistral OCR**, where users upload images/PDFs, OCR is run via Mistral API, and the **text can be downloaded**. Below is a clean **project structure + complete starter code**.

I’ll keep the API call modular so you can easily swap models/endpoints if Mistral updates them.

streamlit
requests
python-dotenv
Pillow
```

If you want PDF preview later, we can add `pymupdf`.

---

# ✅ .env

```
MISTRAL_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

# ✅ services/mistral_ocr.py

> ⚠️ Endpoint may evolve. This is written in a **configurable way** so you only change URL + payload if needed.

```python

```

---

# ✅ utils/file_utils.py

```python

```

---

# ✅ app.py (Streamlit App)

```python

```

---

# ✅ Run the App

```bash
cd mistral_ocr_app
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

---

# 🔥 Optional Upgrades (I can give code if you want)

Since you’re doing a lot of Streamlit tooling already, nice additions would be:

### ✅ Batch OCR (multiple files)

Upload many → ZIP download of all results

### ✅ Structured OCR Output

Export as:

* `.txt`
* `.json`
* `.csv` (page-wise)

### ✅ Layout-aware OCR

If Mistral returns bounding boxes:

* Render text blocks
* Table reconstruction

### ✅ OCR → LLM cleanup

Post-process text with:

* paragraph formatting
* heading detection
* table extraction

---

## If you want, next step I can give you:

* ✅ Version using **Mistral Vision Chat API instead of OCR endpoint**
* ✅ Batch OCR with progress bar
* ✅ PDF page-by-page OCR
* ✅ Dockerized version for deployment

Just tell me which direction you want to extend this, and I’ll tailor it to your workflow (same style as your other Streamlit tools).

Nice idea 👍 — this is very useful for prompt engineering experiments.

Below is a **complete Streamlit app** that lets you:

* ✅ Choose **Zero-shot / Few-shot**
* ✅ Enter **system + user prompt**
* ✅ Add **few-shot examples (Q/A pairs)**
* ✅ Select **OpenRouter model**
* ✅ Call OpenRouter API and show response

Given your background in NLP + ML projects, next upgrades could be:

### ✅ Prompt Dataset Mode

Upload CSV/JSON of prompts and run batch inference.

### ✅ Evaluation Mode

Compare:

* zero-shot vs few-shot
* multiple models
* BLEU / ROUGE / embedding similarity

### ✅ Prompt Templates

Save:

* system prompt templates
* few-shot libraries

### ✅ Cost Tracking

Estimate token usage per model (OpenRouter pricing).

If you want, next I can give you:

* 📁 Version with **batch CSV testing**
* 📊 Version with **model comparison side-by-side**
* 🧠 Version with **automatic few-shot retrieval (RAG-style)**

Just tell me which direction you want to go.


Great follow-up, Daris — this is exactly where zero/few-shot playgrounds become **real research + product tooling** 👍

I’ll cover:

1. ✅ How to add **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mode** in your Streamlit + OpenRouter app
2. ✅ Safe way: **Hidden CoT vs Short Reasoning** (best practice)
3. ✅ Prompt strategies: Zero-shot CoT, Few-shot CoT, Self-consistency
4. ✅ Fine-tuning strategy (when + how)
5. ✅ Practical pipeline: from playground → dataset → fine-tuned model

---

# ✅ 1. Adding Chain-of-Thought Mode in Your App

### 🔹 UI: Reasoning Mode Selector

Add in sidebar:

```python
reasoning_mode = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Reasoning Mode",
    [
        "Direct Answer",
        "Explain Step-by-Step",
        "Hidden Reasoning (Answer Only)",
    ]
)
```

---

### 🔹 Prompt Injection Strategy

Before building `messages`, modify system prompt:

```python
if reasoning_mode == "Explain Step-by-Step":
    system_prompt += "\nPlease explain your reasoning step by step before giving the final answer."

elif reasoning_mode == "Hidden Reasoning (Answer Only)":
    system_prompt += (
        "\nThink step by step internally, but only output the final answer."
    )
```

👉 This is aligned with current LLM safety practice:

* Model reasons internally
* User only sees concise answer

---

### 🔹 Few-shot with CoT Examples

Few-shot examples should include reasoning:

**User:**

> If I have 3 apples and buy 2 more, how many?

**Assistant:**

> Step 1: Start with 3 apples.
> Step 2: Buy 2 more → total = 5.
> Final answer: 5

Your few-shot editor already supports this — just put reasoning inside `a`.

---

# ✅ 2. Best Practice: Visible vs Hidden CoT

| Mode                 | When to Use                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Explain Step-by-Step | Education, debugging, research          |
| Hidden Reasoning     | Production apps, exams, sensitive logic |
| Direct Answer        | Speed + cost saving                     |

👉 Many models now follow:

> “Think silently, answer briefly”

This reduces hallucinated reasoning.

---

# ✅ 3. Advanced Reasoning Prompting Strategies

### ✅ Zero-shot CoT

Add to system:

> Let’s think step by step.

Works surprisingly well for math, logic, planning.

---

### ✅ Few-shot CoT

Provide 2–4 examples with reasoning, then final query.

This is **very powerful** and often beats fine-tuning for small tasks.

---

### ✅ Self-Consistency (Advanced)

Run same prompt multiple times:

* temperature = 0.7
* collect 5 answers
* majority vote / semantic clustering

Good for:

* math
* logical QA
* classification

You can later extend your app to:

```text
Runs = 5 → aggregate answers
```

---

# ✅ 4. When Do You Actually Need Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is useful when:

✅ Task is repetitive & structured
✅ You have >500 good examples
✅ Prompting becomes very long / expensive
✅ Domain language is specific (medical, legal, ESG, parliamentary — your area 👀)

Not good when:

❌ You only want better reasoning
❌ Task changes often
❌ Data is small (<200 samples)

---

# ✅ 5. Fine-Tuning Strategy (Modern LLMOps Way)

## 🧩 Step 1 — Log Playground Interactions

From your app, save:

```json
{
  "system": "...",
  "messages": [...],
  "output": "...",
  "rating": 1-5
}
```

Store as:

* JSONL
* or CSV

This becomes **training data** later.

---

## 🧩 Step 2 — Clean Dataset

Convert to format:

### Instruction Tuning Format

```json
{
  "instruction": "Classify ESG risk",
  "input": "Company dumped waste...",
  "output": "High environmental risk"
}
```

Or Chat format:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role":"system","content":"..."},
    {"role":"user","content":"..."},
    {"role":"assistant","content":"..."}
  ]
}
```

---

## 🧩 Step 3 — Choose Fine-Tuning Method

### 🔹 Option A: LoRA / QLoRA (Recommended)

Train adapters only.

Tools:

* HuggingFace PEFT
* Axolotl
* Unsloth (fastest)

Works on:

* LLaMA
* Mistral
* Gemma

GPU: even RTX 3060 can work.

---

### 🔹 Option B: OpenAI / OpenRouter Hosted FT

Easier but:

* expensive
* less control
* model-limited

Good for production pipelines.

---

## 🧩 Step 4 — Evaluate vs Prompting

Always compare:

| Method     | Accuracy | Cost | Latency |
| ---------- | -------- | ---- | ------- |
| Zero-shot  | low      | low  | low     |
| Few-shot   | high     | high | medium  |
| Fine-tuned | high     | low  | low     |

Often best solution:

> Fine-tuned + short prompt

---

# ✅ 6. Suggested Pipeline for You (Given Your Projects)

Since you work on:

* ESG
* policy debates
* multimodal sentiment
* KG-RAG

🔥 Best strategy:

### Phase 1 — Prompt Playground (current app)

* test tasks
* collect logs
* find failure cases

### Phase 2 — Auto Dataset Builder

Streamlit:

* approve good answers
* label errors
* export JSONL

### Phase 3 — Fine-tune Domain Model

* Mistral 7B LoRA
* ESG classifier
* Policy stance detector

### Phase 4 — RAG + Fine-tuned Hybrid

* RAG for facts
* Fine-tune for reasoning style & labeling

This is **exactly what industry ESG intelligence systems use**.

---

# 🚀 If You Want, Next I Can Give You

I can continue with **code-level upgrades**:

### 🔥 Option 1 — Add Chain-of-Thought Toggle + Self-Consistency

→ full Streamlit code

### 🔥 Option 2 — Add Logging + Dataset Export

→ build fine-tuning dataset automatically

### 🔥 Option 3 — Fine-tuning Script (QLoRA with Mistral)

→ training + inference code

### 🔥 Option 4 — RAG + Few-shot Hybrid Architecture

Tell me which one you want first and I’ll go deep into implementation.
